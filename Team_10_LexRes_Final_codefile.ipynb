Petitioner(s)  \\n \\nVersus  \\n \\nUnion of India & Ors        ... Respondent(s)  \\n \\n \\nJ U D G M E N T  \\n  \\n \\nDr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI  \\n \\n1. The incumbent Chief Secretary of the Government of the National Capital \\nTerritory of Delhi (GNCTD) is due to demit office on superannuation on 30 November \\n2023.  The petitioner approached this court on the ground that they have reason to \\nbelieve that the Union of India will unilaterally appoint the Chief Secretary in the \\nexercise of the power under Sections 41 read with 45A(d) read with 45H (2) of the  2 \\n \\n \\nGovernment of N ational Capital Territory of D elhi Act 19911 as amended by the \\nGovernment of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act 20232. The \\npetitioner initiated proceedings under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking:  \\na. A direction restraining respondents from making a unilateral appointment \\nof the Chief Secretary of the GNCTD or extending the tenure of the \\nincumbent Chief Secretary; and  \\nb. An order appointing one of the five senior most officers serving in the \\nAGMUT cadre with the requisite experience of having served in the \\nGNCTD.  \\nThe Solicitor General has apprised the Court that the Union Government proposes to \\ngrant an extension of six months to the incumbent.   \\n2. Article 239AA(3)(a) of the Constitution stipulates that the Legislative Assembly \\nshall have power to make laws with respect to any matter in the State List or Concurrent List insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories except for \\ncertain excluded matters. Among the excluded matters are Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of the State List insofar as they relate to Entries 1, \\n2 and 18.  Consequently, the subjects of (i) Public order (Entry 1); (ii) Police (Entry 2); \\nand (iii) Land (Entry 18) lie outside the legislative domain of the Legislative Assembly. \\nThe division of legislative power between NCTD and the Union of India as stipulated in \\nArticle 238- AA(3) is summarized below :  \\na. The Legislative Assembly of NCTD has the competence to enact laws for \\nthe whole or any part of NCTD in respect of matters enumerated in the \\n \\n1 \\u201cGNCTD Act 1991\\u201d  \\n2 \\u201c2023 Amendment Act \\u201d 3 \\n \\n \\nState List or Concurrent List insofar as such matters are applicable to \\nUnion territories except matters with respect to Entries 1,2, and 18 of the \\nState List and Entries 64,65, and 66 of the State List insofar as they relate \\nto Entries 1 (public order), 2 (police), and 18 (land) of the List3;  \\nb. Parliament shall have the power to enact laws for NCTD with respect to all \\nentries in the State List and Concurrent List4; \\nc. If any provision of a law made by the Legislative Assembly of NCTD is repugnant to a provision of a law made by Parliament, the law made by \\nParliament shall prevail.\\n5   \\n3. Two Constitution Benches of this Court have dealt with the constitutional status \\nimparted to the National Capital Territory by virtue of the provisions of Article 239AA of the Constitution.  These are:  \\n (i) State (NCT of Delhi) Vs Union of India\\n6  \\n (ii) Govt. of NCT of Delhi Vs Union of India7 \\n4. The second decision of the Constitution Bench ( 2023 Constitution Bench \\njudgment)  specifically dealt with control over \\u201cservices\\u201d pertaining to the National \\nCapital Territory of Delhi (NCTD).  The subject o f services is comprised in Entry 41 of \\nthe State List to the Seventh Schedule (\\u201cState Public Services; State Public Services \\nCommission\\u201d).  The 2023 Constitution Bench judgment held that Article 239- AA(3)(a) \\ndoes not exclude the legislative power of NCTD over entries other than those expressly \\n \\n3 Article 239- AA(3)(a)  \\n4 Article 239- AA(3)(b)  \\n5 Article 239- AA(3)(c) \\n6 (2018) 8 SCC 501-   \\n7 (2023) 9 SCC 1 \\u2013    \\u201c2023 Constitution Bench \\u201d 4 \\n \\n \\nexcluded in the provision, and thus, NCTD has legislative competence over \\u201cservices\\u201d. \\nSince executive power is co- extensive with legislative power, this Court held that NCTD \\nwill have executive power over \\u201cservices\\u201d. An incidental issue that arose was with respect to the scope of the executive power over entries over which both the Union of India and NCTD have legislative competence. Drawing upon the principles in Articles \\n73 and 162, the 2023 Constitution Bench held that on entries over which Parliament \\nalso has legislative competence, the executive power shall ordinarily lie with NCTD. \\nHowever, such executive power would be \\u201csubject to and limited by\\u201d the executive \\npower expressly conferred upon the Union of India by provisions of the Constitution or a \\nlaw made by Parliament.\\n8 The relevant observation is extracted below:  \\n\\u201c85. [\\u2026] The executive power of NCTD shall extend to all entries \\nin List II and List III, other than the entries expressly excluded in \\nArticle 239AA(3). Such power shall be subject to the executive \\npower of the Union (through the Lieutenant Governor) only when \\nthe Union has been granted such power by the Constitution or a \\nlaw of Parliament. Therefore, the executive power of NCTD, in \\nthe absence of a law by Parliament, shall extend to all subjects \\non which it has power to legislate.\\u201d  \\n[\\u2026] \\n\\u201c95. [\\u2026] The executive power of the Union, in the absence of a \\nlaw upon its executive power relating to any subject in the State List, shall cover only matters relating to the three entries which \\nare excluded from the legislative domain of NCTD. As a \\ncorollary, in the absence of a law or provision of the Constitution, the executive power of the Lieutenant Governor acting on behalf of the Union Government shall extend only to matters related to \\nthe three entries mentioned in Article 239- AA(3)( a), subject to \\nthe limitations in Article 73. Furthermore, if the Lieutenant \\nGovernor differs with the Council of Ministers of GNCTD , he \\nshall act in accordance with the procedure laid down in the \\nTransaction of Business Rules. However, if Parliament enacts a law granting executive power on any subject which is within the \\n \\n8 The proviso to Article 73 states that the Union of India shall not have executive power on matters over which the \\nState can also enact on unless such power is expressly granted by the Constitution or law of Parliament. The \\nproviso to Article 162 states that on matters over which both the state legislature and Parliament can make laws, \\nthe executive power of States shall be subject to and limited by the executive power expressly conferred upon \\nUnion of India by a law of Parliament or by the Constitution.  5 \\n \\n \\ndomain of NCTD, the executive power of the Lieutenant \\nGovernor shall be modified to the extent, as provided in that law. Furthermore, under Section 49 of the GNCTD  Act, the \\nLieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers must comply with the particular directions issued by the President on specific occasions.\\u201d  \\nThe Court held that NCTD has legislative and executive power with respect to services \\nunder Entry 41.  Since, however, the subjects of Public order, Police and Land are \\nexcluded from the domain of the Legislative Assembly, this Court observed :  \\n\\u201c160. [\\u2026] The legislative and executive power of NCTD over \\nEntry 41 shall not extend over to services related to \\u201cpublic order\\u201d, \\u201cpolice\\u201d and \\u201cland\\u201d. However, legislative and executive \\npower over services such as Indian Administrative Services, or \\nJoint Cadre services, which are relevant for the implementation of policies and vision of NCTD in terms of day -to-day \\nadministration of the region shall lie with NCTD.\\u201d  \\n5. After  the judgment of the 2023 Constitution Bench, the President in the exercise \\nof powers under Article 123 of the Constitution promulgated the Government of National \\nCapital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Ordinance 2023 by which a provision9 was \\nincluded in the GNCTD Act 1991 excluding the legislative competence of the NCTD \\nover Entry 41 of the List II. By an order dated 20 July 2023, this Court referred the issue \\non the contours of the power of Parliament to enact a law under Article 239- AA(7) to a \\nConstitution Bench. By the said order, the application for the stay of the 2023 \\nOrdinance was dismissed.  \\n6. On 11 August 2023, Parliament enacted the 2023 Amendment Act . The \\npetitioners filed an interlocutory application10 seeking an amendment to the writ petition \\nchallenging the provisions of the 2023 Amendment Act.  The constitutional validity of \\nthe provisions of the 2023 Amendment Act is pending adjudication before the \\n \\n9 Section 3A of the 2023 Ordinance  \\n10 IA No. 160111 of 2023 in WP (C) 678 of 2023  6 \\n \\n \\nConstitution Bench.  \\n7. Rule 55(2)(b) of the Transaction of Business of the Government of National \\nCapital Territory of Delhi Rules 199311 requires the Lieutenant Governor to refer a \\nproposal to appoint the Chief Secretary to the Central Government:  \\n\\u201c(2) Subject to any instructions which may from time to time be \\nissued by the Central Government, the Lieutenant Governor \\nshall make a prior reference to the Central Government in the Ministry of Home Affairs  or to the appropriate Ministry with \\na copy to the Ministry of Home Affairs in respect of the \\nfollowing matters :- \\n(a) Proposals affecting the relations of the Central Government with any State Government, the Supreme Court of India or any \\nother High Court;  \\n(b) Proposals for the appointment of Chief Secretary and \\nCommissioner of Police, Secretary (Home) and Secretary \\n(Lands);  \\n(c) important cases which affect or are likely to affect the peace \\nand tranquility of the National Capital Territory; and  \\n(d) cases which affect or are likely to affect the interests of any minority community, Scheduled Castes or the backward classes.\\u201d  \\n(emphasis supplied)  \\n8. Section 41 which deals with matters on which the Lieutenant Governor shall act \\nin his sole discretion has been amended to include,  in clause (iii) of sub- section (1) , the \\ndischarge of functions under Part IV -A of the Act.  Part IV -A has been introduced by \\nway of an amendment.  Section 45A(d) defines the Chief Secretary to mean \\u201cthe Chief \\nSecretary of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi appointed by the \\nCentral Government\\u201d.  Clause (i) of Section 45A defines \\u201cGroup A officers\\u201d in the \\nfollowing terms :  \\n\\u201c(i) \\u201cGroup \\u2018A\\u2019 officers\\u201d means the officers serving in the affairs of \\nthe Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi \\u2014 \\n(a)  belonging to All India Services, except the officers of the \\n \\n11 \\u201cTransaction of Business Rules\\u201d  7 \\n \\n \\nIndian Police Service;  \\n(b)  who are classified as Group \\u2018A\\u2019 officers, under rule 4 of \\nthe Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) \\nRules, 1965,  \\nbut shall not include the officers who are serving in connection \\nwith any subject matter, whether fully or in part connected with Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the \\nConstitution, and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of List II of the Seventh \\nSchedule to the Constitution insofar as they relate to Entries 1, 2 \\nand 18 or any other subject matter which is connected therewith \\nor incidental thereto:  \\n     (emphasis supplied)   \\n9. Among other amendments, Section 45E provides for the constitution of the \\nNational Capital Civil Service Authority . In terms of sub -Section (2) of Section 45E, the \\nAuthority shall consist of the Chief Minister of NCTD, the Chief Secretary of GNCTD, \\nand the Principal Home Secretary of GNCTD.  Section 45H defines the powers and \\nfunctions of the authority.  Sub- section (1) of Section 45H provides as follows:  \\n\\u201c45-H.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law \\nfor the time being in force, the Authority shall have the \\nresponsibility to recommend the transfers and postings of \\nall Group \\u2018A\\u2019 officers  and officers of DANICS serving in the \\naffairs of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi but not officers serving in connection with any subject matter, either fully or in part, connected with Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II  of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution; \\nand Entries 64, 65 and 66 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to \\nthe Constitution insofar as they relate to Entries 1, 2 and 18 or \\nany other subject matter which is connected therewith or \\nincidental thereto, to the Lieutenant Governor:  \\nProvided that Authority may, if it deems appropriate, by way of a \\nrecommendation, delegate the responsibility to any other \\nauthority of the Government of National Capital Territory of \\nDelhi.\\u201d  \\n                (emphasis supplied)  \\n \\n10. Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners \\nsubmits that : 8 \\n \\n \\na. The decision of this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu & \\nAnr12, dwelt with the importance of the post of Chief Secretary in terms of \\nits sensitivity, responsibility and the rapport which is required between the Chief Secretary and the Chief Minister;  \\nb. The provisions of Section 45A(d) contain only a definition of the \\nexpression \\u201cChief Secretary\\u201d and cannot be construed to be a substantive \\nprovision governing the appointment of the Chief Secretary by the Central \\nGovernment;  \\nc. Section 45E of the amended statute which deals with the transfers and postings of the Group A officers under the auspices of the National Capital \\nCivil Service Authority cannot encompass the Chief Secretary who is a ex officio  part of the authority;  \\nd. The power under Rule 55(2)(b) of the Transaction of Business Rules has \\nalways been exercised by the Lieutenant Governor on the aid and advice \\nof the NCTD Government;  \\ne. In terms of the third proviso of Rule 16(1) of the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules 1958\\n13, an extension to a member of the \\nAll India Service holding the post of Chief Secretary to a State Government can be granted for a period of not more than six months \\u201con \\nthe recommendations made by the concerned State Government with full justification and in public interest with the prior approval of the Central \\nGovernment\\u201d ; \\n \\n12  (1974) (4) SCC 3  \\n13 \\u201c1958 Rules\\u201d  9 \\n \\n \\nf. Reference to the State Government in the third proviso to Rule 16 of the \\nAIS (DCRB) Rules 1958 can only mean the GNCTD bearing in mind the \\nobservations in paragraph 173 of the judgment in the 2023 Constitution \\nBench.  Thus, in the absence of its recommendation, which has to be \\nbacked by a justification and in public interest, no extension can be granted unilaterally  by the Central Government;  \\ng. No extension has been granted to the Chief Secretary in GNCTD even in a single instance over 30 years; and  \\nh. Apart from the three expressly excluded entries of the State List pertaining to Police, Public Order and Land, the Chief Secretary also deals with 110 \\nother entries of the Seventh Schedule in the performance of his functions.  That is why a recommendation for the appointment of the Chief Secretary \\nhas emanated from the GNCTD while the appointment is actually made by \\nthe Union Government.  Hence, the proposed extension which is sought to \\nbe granted to the Chief Secretary is without the authority of law.  \\n11. In response to the plea which has been made by the petitioner, an affidavit has \\nbeen filed by the Joint Secretary (Union Territories) in the Union Ministry of Home \\nAffairs.  The affidavit sets out that : \\na. Extensions have been granted in the previous 12 months alone to the Chief Secretar ies in the States of West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh \\nand Madhya Pradesh, as set out in the table extracted below :  \\n 10 \\n \\n \\nName  of the \\nOfficer  Serving  \\nas Chief \\nSecretary  State/  Union  \\nTerritory  Date  of \\nsuperannuation  Period  of \\nExtension Granted  \\nHK Dwivedi,  \\nIAS \\n(WB:1988)  West  Bengal  30.06.2023  06 Months  \\n(from 01.07.2023  \\nto 31.12.2023)  \\nUsha  \\nSharma,  \\nIAS  \\n(RR: 1985)  Rajasthan  30.06.2023  06 Months  \\n(from 01.07.2023  \\nto 31.12.2023)  \\nDurga  \\nShanker \\nMishra, IAS \\n(UP: 1984)   \\nUttar  Pradesh   \\n31.12.2021  01 year \\n(from 01.01.2022  \\nto 31.12.2022)  \\n01 year \\n(from 01.01.2023  \\nto 31.12.2023)  \\nIqbal Singh  \\nBains, IAS \\n(MP:  1985)  Madhya  Pradesh  30.11.2022  06 Months  \\n(from 01.12.2022  \\nto 31.05.2023)  \\n06 months  (from  \\n01.06.2023  to \\n30.11.2023)  \\nb.

There are as many as 57 instances since 2013 where extensions have \\nbeen granted to superannuating Chief Secretaries which have been \\ntabulated in the affidavit;  \\nd. Section 45A, though a part of the definition provisions of the amended Act, \\nexpressly recognises the power of appointment of the Central Government \\nof the Chief Secretary of the NCTD;  \\ne. Though the power of granting an extension to a member of an All India \\nService holding the post of Chief Secretary under Rule 16 of the 1958 \\nRules is to be exercised by the Central Government on the \\nrecommendations of the State Government, in the case of the NCTD , the \\nrelevant cadre deploying the officers is the AGMUT cadre which is a Joint 16 \\n \\n \\nCadre.  Rule 2(1)(m) defines the State Government in the case of a joint \\ncadre to mean the Joint Cadre Authority14; and \\nf. The Government of India Allocation of Business Rules 1961 provide, in \\nrelation to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, that :  \\n\\u201c(d) General Questions relating to public services in the Union \\nTerritories and service matters in so far as these fall within the purview of State Government relating to:  \\n(i) the officers of Indian Administrative Service and Indian \\nPolice Service serving in connection with the affairs of \\nthe Union Territories;  \\n(ii) NCT of Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, \\nLakshdweep, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar \\nhaveli Civil and Police Services (DANICS and \\nDANIPS);  \\n(iii) Pondicherry Civil and Police Services.\\u201d  \\n12. The submissions which were urged by the Solicitor General have been \\nsupplemented by Mr Sanjay Jain, senior counsel.  Mr. Jain submitted that : \\na. The decision of this Court in the 2023 Constitution Bench makes it clear \\nthat the executive role of the NCTD does not extend to services related to \\npublic order, police and land keeping in view that Entries 1, 2 and 18 stand \\nexcluded from the legislative power of NCTD ;  \\nb. The Chief Secretary indivisibly performs functions relating to Entries 1, 2 \\nand 18;  \\nc. Consequently, in the appointment of the Chief Secretary, as well as in the \\nappointment of the Secretary (Home), Secretary (Land) and Commissioner \\n \\n14 Rule 2(1)(m): State Government means the State Government on whose cadre the member of the Service was \\nborne immediately before retirement or death and in relation to a member of an All India Service borne on a joint \\ncadre, the joint cadre Authority.  17 \\n \\n \\nof Police, the elected Government of NCTD would not have any control ; \\nd. After the insertion of Article 239AA, a proposal for the appointment of \\nofficers to these four posts was invariably moved by the Lieutenant \\nGovernment to the Central Government in the Ministry of Home Affairs in \\nterms of Rule 55(2)(b) of the Transaction of Business Rules ; \\ne. In terms of Rule 56, whenever a proposal is received under Rule 55(2)(b) \\nfrom the Lieutenant Governor, the Central Government would have to take \\nthe appropriate decision;  and \\nf. Section 41 of the GNCTD Act deals with matters in which the Lieutenant Governor may act in his sole discretion and even prior to the amendment, \\nit was permissible for him to act without aid and advice in all matters falling outside the purview of the Legislative Assembly, namely Entries 1, 2 and \\n18 of the State List.  \\n13. At this stage, it must be noted that the reference before the Constitution bench is \\npending and there is no stay on the operation of the amendment Act. Thus , only a \\nprima facie view is formed on the merits of the rival submissions.  \\n14. In its decision in 2023 Constitution Bench,  this Court held that :  \\na. The subject of \\u2018services\\u2019 falls within the ambit of the legislative and executive competence of NCTD under Entry 41 of the State List of the \\nSeventh Schedule;  \\nb. However, the legislative and executive power of NCTD over Entry 41 does \\nnot extend over services related to the excluded subjects of public order, \\npolice and land;  18 \\n \\n \\nc. In the absence of a law conferring upon it executive power relating to any \\nsubject in the State List, the executive power of the Union Government \\ncovers only matters relating to the three entries which are excluded from \\nthe legislative domain of NCTD;  \\nd. If Parliament enacts a law granting executive power on any subject which \\nis within the domain of NCTD, the executive power of the Lieutenant \\nGovernor shall be modified to that extent as provided in the law;  \\ne. The Lieutenant Governor is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of NCTD in relation to matters which fall within the legislative \\ndomain of NCTD; and  \\nf. NCTD has legislative power over services excluding public order, police \\nand land. Hence, the Lieutenant Governor is bound by the decisions of \\nGNCTD on services, save and except for the excluded subjects and as modified by the law.  \\nThese principles have been culled out prima facie  at this stage on an analysis of the \\nobservations of the judgment in 2023 Constitution Bench.  \\n15. Two issues fall for the consideration of this Court: firstly, whether the Union \\nGovernment has the unilateral power to appoint the Chief Secretary of NCTD; and secondly, whether the Union Government has the power to extend the service of the \\nincumbent Chief Secretary.   \\n16. We will first deal with the issue of whether the Union Government has the \\nunilateral power to appoint the Chief Secretary of NCTD. Rule 2(b) of the Indian 19 \\n \\n \\nAdministrative Service (Cadre) Rules 195415 defines Cadre post as any of the posts \\nspecified under item 1 of each cadre in the Schedule to the Indian Administrative \\nService (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations 195516. The 1955 Regulations \\nmention Chief Secretary as one of the cadre posts. Rule 7 of the 1954 Rules states that \\nall appointments to cadre posts in a joint cadre shall be made by the State Government \\nconcerned. The State Government is defined in relation to a Joint cadre to mean the \\nJoint Cadre Authority. Rule 11A of the 1954 Rules states that the power of the State \\nGovernment , inter alia, under Rule 7 in relation to the members of the Service serving \\nin connection with the affairs of any of the constituent States shall be exercised by the \\nGovernment of that State, and State is defined to include Union Territory17. The 2023 \\nConstitution Bench judgment interpreted the above provisions and held that the GNCTD \\nhas the power to make appointments to cadre posts in NCTD:  \\n\\u201c173. We shall take the example of the Indian Administrative \\nService (Cadre) Rules, 1954, which deal with the posting of IAS \\nOfficers. Rule 2(a) defines \\u201ccadre officer\\u201d to mean a member of \\nIAS. Rule 2(b) defines \\u201cCadre post\\u201d as any post specified under Item I of each cadre in the Schedule to the Indian Administrative Service (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations, 1955. Rule \\n2(c) defines \\u201cState\\u201d to mean a State specified in the Schedule I \\nto the Constitution and includes a Union Territory. Rule 2(d) defines \\u201cState Government concerned\\u201d, in relation to a Joint \\ncadre, to mean the Joint Cadre Authority. The constitution and \\ncomposition of a \\u201cJoint Cadre Authority\\u201d is understood with reference to the All -India Services (Joint Cadre) Rules, 1972. \\nThe 1972 Rules apply to a \\u201cJoint Cadre constituted for any group \\nof States other than the Joint Cadre of Union Territories\\u201d.  Rule 3 \\nof the IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954 provides for the constitution of cadres for each State or group of States \\u201cas a \\u201cState Cadre\\u201d or, \\nas the case may be, a \\u201cJoint Cadre\\u201d. Rule 5 empowers the \\nCentral Government to allocate cadre officers to various cadres. In terms of Rule 5(1), the allocation of cadre officers to the \\n \\n15 \\u201c1954 Rules\\u2019  \\n16 \\u201c1955 Regulations\\u201d  \\n17 Rule 2(c) of the 1955 Regulations  20 \\n \\n \\nvarious cadres shall be made by the Central Government in \\nconsultation with the State Government or the State Government concerned. Rule 7 stipulates that all appointments to cadre posts \\nshall be made \\u201con the recommendation of the Civil Services \\nBoard\\u201d \\u2014 by the State Government \\u201cin the case of a State \\ncadre\\u201d, and by the State Government concerned, as defined in Rule 2(d), \\u201cin the case of a joint cadre\\u201d. Under Rule 11- A, the \\n\\u201cGovernment of that State\\u201d is provided with powers to take decisions under Rule 7 (and other mentioned rules) in relation to \\nthe members of the Joint Cadre Service \\u201cserving in connection \\nwith the affairs of any of the Constituent States\\u201d.  A combined \\nreading of Rules 2, 7 and 11- A indicates that the postings \\nwithin the State Cadre as well as Joint Cadre of a \\nConstituent State shall be made by the \\u201cGovernment of that \\nState\\u201d, that is, by the duly elected Government.  In our case, it \\nshall be the Government of NCTD. We accordingly hold that \\nreferences to \\u201cState Government\\u201d in relevant Rules of All -India \\nServices or Joint Cadre Services, of which NCTD is a part or which are in relation to NCTD, shall mean the Government of NCTD.\\u201d  \\n     \\n            (emphasis supplied)  \\n \\n17. However, the scope of Rule 55(2)(b) of the Transaction of Business Rules must \\nalso be noticed. Rule 55(2)(b) requires the Lieutenant Governor, subject to any \\ninstructions which may be issued by the Central Government, to make a prior reference \\nto the Central Government of proposals for the appointment of Chief Secretary and \\nCommissioner of Police, Secretary (Home) and Secretary (Lands). Rule 56 provides \\nthat when a matter has been referred by the Lieutenant Governor to the Central \\nGovernment under Rule 55, further action shall not be taken except in accordance with the decision of the Central Government. Though the Government of NCTD is the \\nappointing authority for all posts in NCTD in terms of the 1954 Rules, the Transaction of \\nBusiness Rules places the appointments to the posts of Chief Secretary and \\nCommissioners of Police, Secretary (Home) and Secretary (Lands) outside the \\ncompetence of the GNCTD.  21 \\n \\n \\n18. The reason for this provision would emerge from the three excluded subjects of \\nEntries 1, 2 and 18 of List 2 of the State List which fall outside the purview of the \\nGNCTD.  The excluded subjects being \\u2018Police\\u2019, \\u2018Public order\\u2019 and \\u2018Land\\u2019, the \\nCommissioner of Police and the Secretaries In- charge of the Home and Land \\nDepartments are specifically brought within the purview of those matters where the \\nLieutenant Governor has to make a prior reference to the Union Government.  The \\nChief Secretary has, in addition, been brought within the purview of Rule 55(2)(d) for \\nthe reason that the Chief Secretary of the GNCTD exercises overall supervision and \\ncontrol over all the departments including the departments which are relatable to the \\nexcluded subjects.  \\n19. Significantly, at this stage, it will be material to note that the amendments which \\nhave been made to the GNCTD Act 1991 by the insertion of Pat IV -A contain analogous \\nprovisions in clause (i) of Section 45A by excluding officers who are serving in \\nconnection with any subject matter whether fully or in part connected with Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II (and Entries 64, 65 and 66 insofar as they relate to Entries 1, 2 and 18) \\nfrom the ambit of the definition of Group A officers.  Likewise, while defining the powers \\nand functions of the National Capital Civil Service Authority in Section 45H, officers who \\nare serving in connection with any subject matter, either fully or in part, connected with \\nEntries 1, 2 and 18 of List 2 are excluded specifically . \\n20. The petitioners submit that the Lieutenant Governor has always exercised the \\npower under Rule 55(2) under the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. In terms of Article 239- AA(4), the Lieutenant Governor shall exercise his functions with the aid and \\nadvice of the Council of Ministers in relation to matters with respect to which the 22 \\n \\n \\nLegislative Assembly has the power to make laws, except insofar as he is, by or under \\nany law, required to act in his discretion.  \\n21. Section 41 of the GNCTD Act lists the matters on which the Lieutenant Governor \\nmay act at his discretion. The provision states that the Lieutenant Governor may act in \\nhis discretion: (a) on matters which are beyond the powers of the Legislative Assembly \\nand where the President has delegated the powers and functions to the Lieutenant \\nGovernor in relation to such matters; and (b) on matters which by law require him to act \\nin his discretion or where he is exercising judicial or quasi -judicial functions.   \\n22. The question of whether the Lieutenant Governor should act on the aid and \\nadvice of the Council of Ministers while discharging the function under Rule 55(2)(b) \\nmust be answered in light of the following position of law:  \\na. The judgment of this Court in the 2023 Constitution Bench that the \\nlegislative and executive power of NCTD shall extend to services except \\nservices related to the excluded entries (that is, public order, police, and \\nland); and  \\nb.  The Lieutenant Governor is required to act on the aid and advice of the \\nCouncil of Ministers only on matters over which the Legislative Assembly \\nof NCTD has competence. Even with respect to such matters, the \\nLieutenant Governor may act on his discretion if the law provides so. [ 2023 \\nConstitution Bench judgment , Article 239 -AA(4) of the Constitution and \\nSection 41 of the GNCTD Act]  \\n23. The Lieutenant Governor while exercising the power under Rule 55(2)(b) is \\nrequired to act at their discretion without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers 23 \\n \\n \\nfor the following reasons:  \\na. The provision mandates the Lieutenant Governor to make a reference to \\nthe Central Government of every proposal which relates to the \\nappointments stipulated in the provision. This is clear from the usage of the words \\u201cthe Lieutenant Governor shall make a prior reference;  \\nb.  Rule 55(2) begins with the phrase \\u201csubject to any instructions which may \\nfrom time to time be issued by the Central Government\\u201d. The exercise of \\npower by the Lieutenant Governor under Rule 55(2)(b) is subject to the \\ncontrol of the Central Government;  \\nc. As discussed above, Rule 55(2)(b) deals with proposals for the appointment of the Commissioner of Police and the Secretaries In- charge \\nof the Home and Land Departments in addition to the Chief Secretary. The \\nChief Secretary has  been brought within the purview of Rule 55(2)(b) \\nbecause the Chief Secretary of the GNCTD exercises overall supervision \\nand control over all the departments including the departments which are \\nrelatable to the excluded subjects; and \\nd. The Central Government has a veto over the proposal in terms of Rule 56.   \\n24. The position which emerges from the above analysis is that unlike other States, \\nthe GNCTD only has the power to propose a candidate for the appointment as the Chief Secretary. The Lieutenant Governor is bound to refer the proposal to the Central Government and the decision of the Central Government on the proposal is final.  \\n25. Section 45A(d) defines the Chief Secretary to mean the Chief Secretary of the \\nGNCTD \\u201cappointed by the Central Government\\u201d.  At  this stage, it may not be necessary 24 \\n \\n \\nto enquire into whether clause (d) of Section 45A is purely a definition section, as the \\npetitioners submit, or whether it contains a substantive power of appointment, as is \\nsubmitted by the respondents.  At the present stage, it would suffice to note that there \\ncan be no dispute about the basic position that the Chief Secretary, as the head of the administration, exercises jurisdiction of an administrative nature over the entirety of \\nsubjects which fall within the domain of the executive functions of GNCTD which would \\ninclude those subjects (Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II) over which the Legislative \\nAssembly and the State Government do not have jurisdiction.  \\n26. In the 2023 Constitution Bench judgment , this Court, while holding that the \\nsubject of services in Entry 41 of List II falls within the domain of GNCTD , has \\nnonetheless clarified that this would not extend to control over services insofar as they \\npertain to the excluded subjects.  In the very nature of things, it would not be possible or \\nfor that matter practicable to divide these functions of the Chief Secretary or bifurcate \\nthem between those areas which fall within the domain of GNCTD and those which lie outside.  Nor can such  a bifurcation be logically attempted based on the numerical \\nstrength of the number  of administrative subjects which lie within or outside the \\nprovince of GNCTD.  Once it emerges that the Chief Secretary performs important \\nfunctions, among other things, in relation to the excluded subjects as well, it would be \\nfarfetched to postulate that the Central Government is divested of the power to appoint \\nthe Chief Secretary.   27. The petitioners while referring to the observations of this Court in Royappa \\n(supra) contend that the Central Government cannot unilaterally appoint the Chief Secretary because the Chief Secretary in addition to the subjects of land, police, and 25 \\n \\n \\npublic order also assists the Government of NCTD on a variety of other matters which \\nfalls within the legislative and executive competence of NCTD. However, these are \\ngrounds which can be raised when the challenge to the constitutional validity of the \\nprovisions of the 2023 Amendment Act is adjudicated. In view of the fact that this Court has not stayed the provisions of the NCT Amendment Act, this Court must adjudicate \\nthe controversy based on the position of law as it exists today.  \\n28. The petitioners seek that  the Court to appoint one of the five senior most officers \\nfrom the pool of officers who are serving in the AGMUT cadre and who has had the experience of having served as the Chief Secretary in the Government of NCTD. The \\nrelief  sought by the petitioner is beyond the scope of powers exercisable by this Court. \\nThis Court cannot usurp the powers of the appointing authority conferred by law.  \\n29. The issue which survives for consideration is as to whether the Central \\nGovernment has the power to extend the service of an incumbent Chief Secretary.  The \\nUnion Government, inter alia, relied upon the provisions of Rule 16 of the AIS (DCRB) Rules 1958.  Dr Singhvi urged that the third proviso to Rule 16 clearly stipulates that an \\nextension of service can be granted to a person holding the post of Chief Secretary to a \\nState Government on the recommendations made by the concerned State Government \\n\\u201cwith full justification and in public interest\\u201d with the prior approval of the Central \\nGovernment.  Hence, it was urged that the power of extension can be exercised only on \\nthe recommendation of the State Government which, in the present case, must mean, the GNCTD.   \\n30. On the other hand, an effort has been made on behalf of the Union Government \\nto submit that in a case involving a joint cadre, the expression State Government must 26 \\n \\n \\nmean the Joint Cadre Authority and bearing in mind the Transaction of Business Rules \\n1961 of the Union Government, it is the Ministry of Home Affairs which alone would \\nexercise jurisdiction on general questions relating to public services in the Union \\nTerritories and service matters pertaining to IAS and IPS officers serving in connection with the affairs of the Union Territories.  \\n31. This submission of the Union Government has not found acceptance in the 2023 \\nConstitution Bench judgment. Paragraph 173 of the judgment (extracted above) holds \\nthat the GNCTD would exercise jurisdiction over public services in NCTD.   \\n32. Rule 16 of the 1958 Rules is a general rule which is applicable to members of the \\nservice holding the post of Chief Secretary across all States. The provision does not make a distinction between the Chief Secretary serving in NCTD and the Chief Secretaries serving in other States though the procedure for the appointment of the \\nChief Secretary of NCTD is different from the procedure for the appointment of Chief \\nSecretaries in other States in terms of the 1954 Rules read with the Transaction of Business Rules. The post of Chief Secretary in the GNCTD is a post entrusted with \\nsignificant functional responsibilities including overall administrative control and \\nsupervision over subjects which stand excluded from the legislative domain and the \\nexecutive powers of the GNCTD.  In relation to Chief Secretaries who are appointed to \\nthe States, Rule 16 of the 1958 Rules contemplates that an extension can be granted \\nwith the prior approval of the State Government on the recommendation by the State Government with a \\u201c full justification \\u201d and in \\u201c public interest \\u201d.  This provision has been \\nmade in relation to the role of the State Government where the Chief Secretaries perform functions in relation to the States.  The position of the Chief Secretary of the 27 \\n \\n \\nGNCTD is significantly distinct in that the Chief Secretary performs delegated executive \\nfunctions which straddle both subjects which fall within the executive and legislative \\ncompetence  of GNCTD as well as those which lie outside.  Consequently, the \\nrestrictions which operate in relation to the grant of extension under Rule 16 of the 1958 \\nRules in relation to the Chief Secretary of one of the State Governments would not \\nstricto senso  apply in relation to the GNCTD.  Rule 16 undoubtedly would, however, \\napply in relation to the extension of service of such other officers of GNCTD whose functions do not extend to any of the subjects which are excluded, namely, Entries 1, 2 \\nand 18 of List 2 and Entries 64, 65 and 66 insofar as thy are relat able to Entries 1, 2 \\nand 18.  \\n33. For the above reasons, we have come to the conclusion that at this stage, \\nbearing in mind the principles which have been enumerated in the judgment of this \\nCourt in 2023 Constitution Bench judgment, and the subsequent developments which \\nhave taken place resulting in the enactment of the amendment to the GNCTD Act 1991, the decision of the Union Government to extend the services of the incumbent Chief \\nSecretary for a period of six months cannot be construed to be violative of law.  \\n34. We, however, clarify that the analysis in this order is confined to the evaluation of \\nthe case at the present stage without entering into any conclusive determination of the issues which are pending for adjudication before the Constitution Bench.  \\n35. We also deem it appropriate to record a few observations on the role of the Chief \\nSecretary. As observed by this Court in Royappa (supra), the post of the Chief \\nSecretary is a \\u201cpost of great confidence-  a lynchpin in the administration.\\u201d This Court in \\nthe 2023 Constitution Bench judgment observed that civil servants are required to be 28 \\n \\n \\npolitically neutral and must abide by the directions of the elected arm to give effect to \\nthe principle underlying the triple- chain of collective responsibility. The post of a Chief \\nSecretary is uniquely placed. The Chief Secretary performs functions which fall both within and outside the executive competence of the GNCTD. The Chief Secretary though appointed by the Central Government, must comply with the directions of the \\nelected government over matters on which their executive competence extends. The \\nactions (or inactions) of the Chief Secretary must not put the elected government at a \\nstandstill.  \\n \\n36. The writ petition is disposed of in terms of the above observations. Pending \\napplication(s), if any, stand disposed of.  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\u2026\\u2026.\\u2026...\\u2026...\\u2026.......\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026....\\u2026C JI. \\n                                                         [Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]  \\n \\n     \\n \\n                                     \\n\\u2026.\\u2026.......\\u2026...\\u2026.......\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026....\\u2026 ..J. \\n                                                                          [J B Pardiwala]  \\n  \\n \\n                                                      \\n..\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026.\\u2026...\\u2026.......\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026....\\u2026 ..J. \\n                                  [Manoj Misra]  \\n \\nNew Delhi;  \\nNovember 29, 2023.  \\nGKA  \\n \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 8607,\n        \"max\": 8607,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8607\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentence_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 202,\n        \"max\": 202,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          202\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Rajendra Babu, J. & S.N. Phukan, J.\\nJUDGMENT:\\nRAJENDRA BABU, J. :\\nL...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J\\nBy an order made on July 6, 1996, this Court finalised\\nthe scheme of rehabilitation of Ashok Paper Mills in\\nDarbhanga in State of Bihar. However, that scheme could not\\nbe given effect to due to one reason or the other and this\\nCourt on April 26, 1999 considered various aspects of the\\nmatter and made an order on I.A.No.13 in W.P. (C) No.\\n174/91.\\nAfter considering the various circumstances, this Court\\ndirected that State of Bihar should stand guarantee for the\\nsupply of four diesel generating sets to the tune of three\\ncrores so that the difficulty in getting the power supply\\nwould stand obviated and the company should give the\\nproposal to the State of Bihar in that regard upon which\\nappropriate orders should be passed by the Government. It\\nwas specifically noticed that the petitioner union, though\\nwas all along prepared to enter into the agreement but some\\nhow it could not be done but subsequently another registered\\nunion, viz., Ashok Paper Mills Mazdoor Panchayat Union\\nentered into an agreement. This Court stated on the\\nagreement entered into with the latter Union in the\\nfollowing terms :\\n.. Without delving into the question as to whether\\nthe Kamgar Union itself did not participate in the\\nproceedings and did not enter into an agreement or the Union\\nwas prevented by some other process since a registered Union\\nhas already entered into an agreement and the such Union has\\nmembership of 243, we think it appropriate to hold that the\\nsaid agreement would be valid agreement for the purpose of\\nimplementation of the scheme. But at the same time, we also\\ngrant an opportunity to Kamgar Union to enter into an\\nagreement with the same terms which has already been entered\\ninto by the other Mazdoor Panchayat Union and this may be\\ndone within a period of four weeks from today and if such an\\nagreement is entered into within this period then this will\\nbe in accordance with the terms of the scheme itself.\\nIf, however, Kamgar Union does not enter into any\\nagreement within four weeks from today then they cannot\\ncomplain of other union having already entered into thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3\\nterms with the Company and the individual members of the\\nUnion those who are interested in abiding by the agreement\\nalready entered into by the other Union can do so on their\\nown and this should be also in accordance with the scheme\\nthat has been approved by this Court.\\nThereafter a review petition was filed questioning the\\ncorrectness of this order. However, that review petition\\nstood dismissed.\\nIt is the contention of the Petitioner that under the\\nscheme finalised by this Court on 6.7.96, clause 1.4 has not\\nbeen implemented in the true spirit thereof; that the\\ntake-over, though was originally stated to be from 18.8.97,\\nsubsequently the monitoring committee fixed the date to be\\n26.12.1997, even so within six months thereof, the work\\nforce has not been absorbed by NCFL nor entered into a\\ntripartite agreement between the workers union, Government\\nof Bihar and NCFL much less any of the past liabilities have\\nbeen discharged; that the NCFL has also not paid workers\\ntheir monthly salary @ 50% of their last earned salary of\\nthe month when production was not terminated; that, Shri\\nUmadhar Prasad Singh informed that he was agreeable to sign\\nthe agreement provided some changes are made in the draft\\ntripartite agreement; that the suggestions made by him were\\ndiscussed by the monitoring committee, found to be\\nreasonable and should be included in the tripartite\\nagreement; that no such agreement was entered into but on\\nthe other hand an agreement has been entered into with\\nanother union; that a secret letter was sent by the Labour\\nCommissioner on May 4, 1998 stating that the said Shri\\nUmadhar Prasad Singh, President of the Petitioner union has\\nbeen adopting an attitude of non-cooperation and was taking\\nan aggressive stand, though there was merit in the claim\\nmade by him in regard to fixation of wages which should be\\ncovered by the prescribed norms of industry based on the\\nlength of service, experience, technical knowledge,\\nacquisition of skills and if unskilled then the knowledge of\\nthe work which the worker had acquired during the course of\\nwork; that a memorandum of tripartite agreement was arrived\\nat by NCLF and, on behalf of the workmen, by the Ashok Paper\\nMills Mazdoor Panchayat Union on May 20, 1998 had almost\\nsurrendered their normal claims of workmen for which the\\nPetitioner union has been fighting all along; that the said\\nagreement was entered into by maneuvers of the management of\\nNCLF and, therefore, we should not take note of the same but\\ngive effect to clause 1.4 of the scheme finalised by this\\nCourt independently.\\nWhether there is any merit or none in the arguments on\\nbehalf of the applicant in I.A.No.13, it is not possible for\\nus to go back on the order made by this Court on 26.4.1999\\nand the order made on the review petition. Though Ms.\\nIndira Jaising, learned senior counsel appearing for the\\napplicant, very strenuously and forcefully submitted that\\nthe order made by this Court on 26.4.1999 is only an\\ninterlocutory order, we do not think that it would be\\ncorrect to state so because the specific manner in which the\\nscheme had to be implemented has been considered by this\\nCourt in the aforesaid order. The very arguments advanced\\nbefore us now had been raised in the review petition but\\nrejected. Therefore, we reject this contention too.\\nHowever, we make it clear that any of the workman who is ahttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3\\nmember of the Petitioner union may also be permitted to join\\nthe work in the NCFL on the terms and conditions stated\\nunder the memorandum of tripartite agreement to which\\nreference has been made by this Court in the orders adverted\\nto above, if such claim is made within a period of one month\\nfrom the date of this order.\\nInterim Application No. 8/2000 in I.A.Nos.3 & 5 in\\nInterlocutory Application No. 13 has also been filed\\nseeking to restrain Shri Umadhar Prasad Singh and his\\nassociates and/or agents from interfering or obstructing in\\nthe reopening/rehabilitation of Ashok Paper Mills Ltd. and\\nfree ingress and egress of personnel of the Mill and\\nmovement of goods inside and outside of the mill and to give\\ndirection to all the persons and concerned agencies for the\\nimplementation of the scheme. It is now brought to our\\nnotice that the mills have started functioning and,\\ntherefore, it is not appropriate to pass any order on this\\nrelief at this stage. So far as the other relief sought for\\nas to co-operation of other agencies is concerned, it is not\\nclear as to what relief the applicant wants and in respect\\nof whom, without which no appropriate direction can be\\ngranted by this Court. Therefore, this relief also cannot\\nbe granted at this stage and in the manner sought for. This\\napplication shall stand disposed of accordingly.',\n",

Rajendra Babu & R.C. Lahoti\\nJUDGMENT:\\nJ U D G M E N TL...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J\\nRAJENDRA BABU, J. :\\nThese two writ petitions have been filed challenging the\\nvalidity of Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925\\n(hereinafter referred to as the Act] as unconstitutional\\nand to restrain the Union of India from enforcing the\\nprovisions thereof against the Indian Christians.\\nIn Writ Petition (C) No. 137 of 1997, petitioner No. 1\\nis an Indian Christian and a citizen of India. He has been\\nin the legal profession for about 48 years, and on account\\nof experience gained in having appeared in many probate\\ncases and had occasions to obtain probate of his fathers\\nWill, his experience has made him decide to file this writ\\npetition. Petitioner No.2 is a Catholic Association of\\nDakshina Kannada, Karnataka. It is submitted that the\\neffect of taking out probate of a Will is to establish the\\ngenuineness or validity of the Will and the grant of probate\\nis not a condition precedent to the vesting of the estate in\\nthe executor in light of the provisions of Section 211 of\\nthe Act. Section 211 of the Act provides for vesting of the\\nproperty in the executor or administrator, as the case may\\nbe, of a deceased person in his legal representative for all\\npurposes. However, when the deceased is a Hindu,\\nMuhammadan, Buddhist, Sikh, Jaina or Parsi nothing contained\\nin the Act shall vest in an executor or administrator any\\nproperty of the deceased person, which would otherwise have\\npassed by survivorship to some other person. Section 213(1)\\nrequires that no right as executor or legatee under a Will\\ncan be established in a Court of Justice without obtaining\\nprobate or letters of administration of the Will under which\\nsuch right is sought to be established. Section 57 of the\\nAct makes it clear that the provisions of that part which\\nare set out in Schedule III subject to the restrictions and\\nmodifications specified therein, shall apply to all Wills\\nand codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina\\nafter the first September, 1870 who are originally residents\\nin the jurisdiction of the High Courts of Judicature at\\nMadras and Bombay or subject to the jurisdiction ofhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 6\\nLieutenant Governor of Bengal and to all such Wills and\\ncodicils made outside those territories and limits so far as\\nrelates to immovable property situate within those\\nterritories or limits and to all Wills and codicils made by\\nany Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina on or after the first day\\nof January, 1927 to which those provisions are not applied\\nby clause (a) and (b), provided that marriage shall not\\nrevoke any such Will or codicils. In view of the aforesaid\\nprovisions, there is compulsory requirement of probating a\\nWill to establish such a right by virtue of the provisions\\nof Section 213 which is made applicable and is restricted to\\nIndian Christians and certain other categories of persons\\nprofessing Hindu and other faiths. The contention of the\\npetitioner is that there is no rational or discernible basis\\nfor making the requirement of probate necessary for only a\\nlimited section of Indian citizens such as Indian Christians\\nexcluding other sections. The Indian Succession Act, 1925\\nrepealing the Indian Succession Act, 1865 was enacted by\\nParliament with a view to consolidate the law applicable to\\nintestate and testamentary succession in India and, as a\\nconsequence no intentional change in the law was made at\\nthat stage. While no distinction is made with respect to\\nestablishing a right to property of a person dying intestate\\nbelonging to different communities and professing different\\nfaiths, Christians alone are subjected to this requirement.\\nIn Writ Petition (C) No. 674 of 1998 petitioner is an\\nIndian Christian who belongs to Roman Catholic community\\nresiding in the State of Kerala. The petitioner was the\\nsole beneficiary of a registered Will dated 15.12.1986\\nexecuted by his aunt Mrs. Lissa Jos Arakal owner of a flat\\nNo. 5, Ashiana Apartment, Pitam Pura, Delhi. She was a\\nChristian and she remained unmarried till her death. Out of\\nlove and affection towards the petitioner she executed a\\nWill on 15.12.1986 bequeathing her entire rights in respect\\nof the said flat in favour of the petitioner. She died on\\n9.8.1991 at Lourdes Hospital, Kochi. The petitioner\\nreceived a letter in August 1993 from the Secretary of M/s\\nLoyola Co- operative Housing Society, Ashiana Apartments,\\nRoad No. 41, Pitam Pura, Delhi stating that the committee\\nof the Society had decided not to hand over the flat to him\\nwithout any court direction. The petitioner also informed\\nthe Society not to transfer the said flat to any one else\\nother than himself. However, he received a reply from the\\nSociety stating that Mr. Barley Arakal is the nominee of\\nthe testatrix as per their record and as such since there is\\na dispute regarding the property the status quo will be\\nmaintained until further orders. It is stated that the\\npetitioner is not in a position to establish his legal right\\nover the property in question or to obtain any relief from\\nthe court on account of the fact that he is a Christian who\\nis bound by the restriction provided under Section 213 of\\nthe Act and since Section 213 of the Act comes in the way of\\nexercising his right, the petitioner is challenging the\\nvalidity of the said provision for identical reasons as set\\nforth in the connected writ petition. It is also brought to\\nour notice in these proceedings that in view of the harsh\\nprocedure contemplated in the provisions under challenge the\\nKerala Legislature has enacted an amendment known as Indian\\nSuccession (Kerala Amendment) Act, 1986 dated 14.3.1997 by\\nwhich sub-section (2) of Section 213 of the Act has been\\namended to the effect that after the word Muhammadans the\\nwords or Indian Christians shall be inserted. It is thus\\nevident from this provision that it would apply to the State\\nof Kerala in respect of the property held by the deceasedhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 6\\nbut it is not clear whether the amendment would apply to the\\nproperty of a testator who belongs to the State of Kerala in\\nrespect of the property situated outside the State of\\nKerala, as in the present case. The petitioner points out\\nthe anomaly arising in the law. Thus a Christian residing\\nin the State of Kerala owning property therein if dies after\\nmaking a Will, the legatee thereto need not to obtain a\\nprobate in terms of Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act\\nbefore establishing their right, while those residing in\\nother parts of the country are required to do so. The\\nanomaly pointed out by the petitioner is that the Will is\\nmade in respect of a property situate in some part of the\\ncountry other than Kerala.\\nThe defence taken by the Government of India is that the\\nmembers of the Christian community are not put to any\\ndiscrimination and they are compelled to obtain probate or\\nletters of administration of the Wills only by way of rule\\nof evidence and procedure and it is intended to provide for\\na right of means of establishing the genuineness of a Will\\nconclusively. So far as marriage and divorce, infants and\\nminors, adoption, wills, intestacy and succession, joint\\nfamily and partition and all matter in respect of which\\nparties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the\\ncommencement of the Constitution subject to their personal\\nlaw, it is open to the State Legislatures to undertake any\\nlegislation of the nature of Section 213 of the Act. The\\nState Governments bring in changes in personal law from time\\nto time as per the social conditions prevailing in the\\nparticular States. Therefore, the amendment made in the\\nState of Kerala would not discriminate the persons residing\\nin other parts of the country. The contention is that the\\nclassification has achieved social acceptance as is evident\\nfrom the fact that it has been in existence in the statute\\nbook for a quite long time and it is not established that\\nhow such classification in the statute suffers in any manner\\nfrom discrimination, and the provisions being procedural in\\nnature are intra vires to the Constitution. It is further\\nsubmitted that the Central Government has been consistently\\nfollowing a policy of non-interference in the personal laws\\nof the minority communities unless the necessary initiative\\nfor amendments or repeal from a majority or sizable cross-\\nsection of the community arises.\\nOn several representations having been made in this\\nregard by the Christian community in India amendment was\\nsought to be introduced by way of a Bill to amend Section\\n213 of the Act to bring Christians at par with other\\ncommunities who are not required to obtain probate. The\\ngrievance of the petitioners in these cases, it is stated,\\nis well brought out in the Statement of Objects and\\nReasons dated May 13, 1942 in respect of proposed amendment\\nof Section 213 which reads as under:-\\nPrior to 1901, Indian Christians laboured under a\\nserious grievance, namely, that they were compelled to\\nobtain probate of wills and letters of administration with\\nliability to pay death duties on the death of every owner of\\nproperty under the Indian Succession Act X of 1865, while\\nHindus and Muslims were exempt from the provisions of the\\nAct. They have since been partially relieved by being\\nplaced practically on the same footing as their\\nnon-Christian countrymen in cases of intestacy under the\\nIndian Christian Estates Administration Act VII of 1901;\\nbut where the deceased has left a will, they are still boundhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 6\\nto obtain probate and pay probate duty as required by\\nsection 213 of the Indian Succession Act XXXIX of 1925, a\\nsection which does not apply to will of Hindu, Buddhists,\\nSikhs or Jains except where such wills are of the class\\nspecified in clauses (a) and (b) of section 57 and to all\\nwills of Muhammadans.\\nThe necessity of making wills has been imposed upon\\nIndian Christians by the provisions of the Indian Succession\\nAct as to intestate succession being made applicable to\\nthem, which are far in advance of their usages and are\\nderived from English law. It is felt as a serious hardship\\nthat in such circumstances Indian Christians should be\\ncompelled to obtain probate and should be made liable to pay\\ndeath duties while their non-Christian countrymen to whom\\nwills are a luxury are exempt. From this injustice they\\nshould be relieved by placing Indian Christians on the same\\nfooting as Hindus and Muhammadans in Sections 213 and 370 of\\nthe Act.\\nSections 57 and 213 of the Act provide as follows :\\n57. Application of certain provisions of Part to a\\nclass of wills made by Hindus, etc. The provisions of this\\nPart which are set out in Schedule III shall, subject to the\\nrestricts and modifications specified therein, apply\\n(a) to all wills and codicils made by any Hindu,\\nBuddhist, Sikh or Jaina, on or after the first day of\\nSeptember, 1870, within the territories which at the said\\ndate were subject to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal or\\nwithin the local limits of the ordinary original civil\\njurisdiction of the High Courts of Judicature at Madras and\\nBombay; and\\n(b) to all such wills and codicils made outside those\\nterritories and limits so far as relates to immovable\\nproperty situate within those territories or limits; and\\n(c) to all wills and codicils made by any Hindu,\\nBuddhist, Sikh or Jaina, on or after the first day of\\nJanuary, 1927, to which those provision:\\nProvided that marriage shall not revoke any such will or\\ncodicil.\\nSection 213. Right as executor or legatee when\\nestablished. (1) No right as executor or legatee can be\\nestablished in any Court of Justice, unless a Court of\\ncompetent jurisdiction in India has granted probate of the\\nwill under which the right is claimed, or has granted\\nletters of administration with the will or with a copy of a\\nauthenticated copy of the will annexed.\\n(2) This section shall not apply in the case of the\\nwills made by Muhammadans, and shall only apply-\\n(i) in the case of wills made by any Hindu, Buddhist,\\nSikh or Jaina where such wills are of the classes specified\\nin clauses (a) and (b) of section 57; and\\n(ii) in the case of wills made by any Parsi dying, after\\nthe commencement of the Indian Succession (Amendment) Act,\\n1962, where such wills are made within the local limits of\\nthe ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Courtshttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 6\\nat Calcutta, Madras and Bombay and where such wills are made\\noutside those limits, in so far as they relate to immovable\\nproperty situate within those limits.\\nHindu Wills Act, 1870 is the forerunner of Section 57 of\\nthe Act. This Section without the proviso together with\\nSchedule III except Article (5) is Section 2 of Hindu Wills\\nAct, 1870 as amended by Section 154 of the Probate and\\nAdministration Act, 1881. The proviso is proviso to Section\\n3 of the Hindu Wills Act. Thus, the scheme of the said\\nenactment is retained in Section 57 of the Act.\\nThe scope of Section 213(1) of the Act is that it\\nprohibits recognition of rights as an executor or legatee\\nunder a will without production of a probate and sets down a\\nrule of evidence and forms really a part of procedural\\nrequirement of the law of forum. Section 213(2) of the Act\\nindicates that its applicability is limited to cases of\\npersons mentioned therein. Certain aspects will have to be\\nborne in mind to understand the exact scope of this section.\\nThe bar that is imposed by this section is only in respect\\nof the establishment of the right as an executor or legatee\\nand not in respect of the establishment of the right in any\\nother capacity. The section does not prohibit the will\\nbeing looked into for purposes other than those mentioned in\\nthe section. The bar to the establishment of the right is\\nonly for its establishment in a court of justice and not its\\nbeing referred to in other proceedings before administrative\\nor other Tribunal. The section is a bar to everyone\\nclaiming under a will, whether as plaintiff or defendant, if\\nno probate or Letters of Administration is granted. The\\neffect of Section 213(2) of the Act is that the requirement\\nof probate or other representation mentioned in sub-section\\n(1) for the purpose of establishing the right as an executor\\nor legatee in a court is made inapplicable in case of a will\\nmade by Muhammadans and in the case of wills coming under\\nSection 57(c) of the Act. Section 57(c) of the Act applies\\nto all wills and codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh\\nor Jain, on or after the first day of January, 1927 which\\ndoes not relate to immovable property situate within the\\nterritory formerly subject to the Lieutenant-Governor of\\nBengal or within the local limits of the ordinary civil\\njurisdiction of the High Courts of Judicature at Madras and\\nBombay, or in respect of property within those territories.\\nNo probate is necessary in the case of wills by Muhammadans.\\nNow by the Indian Succession [Amendment] Act, 1962, the\\nsection has been made applicable to wills made by Parsi\\ndying after the commencement of the 1962 Act. A combined\\nreading of Sections 213 and 57 of the Act would show that\\nwhere the parties to the will are Hindus or the properties\\nin dispute are not in territories falling under Section\\n57(a) and (b), sub-section (2) of Section 213 of the Act\\napplies and sub-section (1) has no application. As a\\nconsequence, a probate will not be required to be obtained\\nby a Hindu in respect of a will made outside those\\nterritories or regarding the immovable properties situate\\noutside those territories. The result is that the\\ncontention put forth on behalf of the Petitioners that\\nSection 213(1) of the Act is applicable only to Christians\\nand not to any other religion is not correct.\\nWe have shown above that it is applicable to Parsis\\nafter the amendment of the Act in 1962 and to Hindus who\\nreside within the territories which on 1.9.1870 were subject\\nto the Lt. Governor of Bengal or to areas covered byhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 6 of 6\\noriginal jurisdiction of the High Courts of Bombay and\\nMadras and to all wills made outside those territories and\\nlimits so far as they relate to immovable property situate\\nwithin those territories and limits. If that is so, it\\ncannot be said that the section is exclusively applicable\\nonly to Christians and, therefore, it is discriminatory.\\nThe whole foundation of the case is thus lost. The\\ndifferences are not based on any religion but for historical\\nreasons that in British Empire in India, probate was\\nrequired to prove the right of a legatee or an executor but\\nnot in Part B or C States. That position has continued\\neven after the Constitution has come into force. Historical\\nreasons may justify differential treatment of separate\\ngeographical regions provided it bears a reason and just\\nrelation to the matter in respect of which differential\\ntreatment is accorded. Uniformity in law has to be\\nachieved, but that is a long drawn process. Undoubtedly,\\nthe States and Union should be alive to this problem. Only\\non the basis that some differences arise in one or other\\nStates in regard to testamentary succession, the law does\\nnot become discriminatory so as to be invalid. Such\\ndifferences are bound to arise in a federal set up.\\nThe learned counsel for the Petitioners relied on the\\ndecisions in B.Venkataramana vs. State of Madras & Anr.,\\nAIR 1951 SC 229, Sheokaransingh vs. Daulatram, AIR 1955\\nRaj. 201, State of Rajasthan & Ors. vs. Thakur Pratap\\nSingh, AIR 1960 SC 1208, Mrs.Hem Nolini Judah vs. Mrs.\\nIsolyne Sarojbashini Bose, 1962 Supp.(3) SCR 294, Mary Sonia\\nZachariah vs. Union of India, 1995(1) KLT 644, Ahmedabad\\nWomen Action Group (AWAG) & Ors. vs. Union of India, 1997\\n(3) SCC 573 and Preman vs. Union of India, 1998(2) KLT\\n1004. However, in the light of the above conclusion, it is\\nunnecessary to refer to those decisions though some of them\\nmay have bearing in analysing and understanding the scope of\\nthe provisions which are made applicable exclusively to\\nChristians as it happened in the case of Section 118 of the\\nAct or in the case of the Indian Divorce Act. Therefore, we\\nhave not adverted to any one of these provisions. If\\nChristians alone had been discriminated against by treating\\nthem as a separate class, we think the argument could have\\nbeen understood and merited consideration.\\nIn that view of the matter, we do not think there is any\\nmerit in these petitions and the same stand dismissed@@\\nJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ\\naccordingly.

The main grounds of detention\\nare that the petitioner was indulging in offences under Section\\n67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, Sections 4 and 6\\nof the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act,\\n1986 and under Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959.\\nOn receipt of the detention order in the Central Prison,\\nChennai, the petitioner informed the detaining authority that he\\nis not able to read and write Tamil, therefore, he is not in a\\nposition to effectively represent against the grounds of\\ndetention supplied to him. In reply to this letter, the 2nd\\nrespondent stated that the statement of the petitioner that he\\ndoes not read and write Tamil is false. At any rate, to be on the\\nsafer side, he supplied to him the copies of the grounds of\\ndetention and the annexures enclosed therewith in English.\\nHis representation to the detaining authority as also to the\\nState Government (respondent No.1) having failed the\\npetitioner has preferred this writ petition.\\nThe first contention raised by the petitioner in this writ\\npetition is that while he was a remand prisoner and before the\\norder of detention dated 18.2.2002 was made by the 2nd\\nrespondent, he had written a letter from the jail to the 2nd\\nrespondent alleging that the Assistant Commissioner of Police,\\nVadapalani had demanded a bribe of Rs.5 lacs from him,\\nthreatening that if he failed to give the bribe then he would\\nmake out false case against him and arrest him. It is also stated\\nbefore us that in the said letter the petitioner had complained to\\nthe 2nd respondent that because of the said failure to pay the\\nbribe he was falsely implicated and arrested and the said police\\nofficer was taking steps to see that the petitioner is not released\\nfrom the jail. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued before\\nus that it is pursuant to this refusal to pay bribe, the very samehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 5\\nofficer has sponsored the case of the petitioner for detention\\nunder the Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982. He further submits from\\nthe register maintained by the Jail Superintendent (respondent\\nNo.3), that it is clear that this letter of the petitioner had reached\\nrespondent No.3, however, he has not taken note of the same\\nwhile passing the order of detention, consequently his detention\\norder suffers from the vice of non application of mind to vital\\nmaterial. The respondent No.2 in his reply filed before this\\nCourt has denied the receipt of any such letter, but since the\\nlearned counsel for the petitioner strongly relied on the\\ndespatch register of the Central Prison, Chennai, to satisfy\\nourselves as to this fact we summoned the said register and\\nexamined the same with the assistance of the counsel for the\\nparties. After perusing the said register, we notice that there is\\nan entry dated 28.1.2002 in regard to a letter despatched by the\\n3rd respondent to the 2nd respondent, which the petitioner claims\\nas his letter complaining against the said police officer. Along\\nwith the register, we have also received a copy of the letter\\nreceived by the Commissioner on 28.1.2002 from the 3rd\\nrespondent and on perusal of the same it is seen that this letter\\nis written by the respondent no.3 to the 2nd respondent in regard\\nto the arrest of one escaped prisoner Ravi and this letter has\\nnothing to do with the complaint allegedly made by the\\npetitioner to the 2nd respondent. Having perused this material,\\nwe are satisfied that the petitioner has not been able to convince\\nus that, as a matter of fact, any such letter dated 28.1.2002 was\\nsent by the petitioner to the 2nd respondent. Therefore, in our\\nopinion, there is no substance in the argument addressed as to\\nthe non-consideration of the letter dated 28.1.2002. Hence, the\\nsame is rejected.\\nLearned counsel then contended that the sponsoring\\nauthority had placed irrelevant and extraneous material before\\nthe detaining authority some of which have been considered by\\nthe detaining authority, hence, his subjective satisfaction is\\nvitiated by the consideration of irrelevant and extraneous\\nmaterial. In support of this contention, the learned counsel\\npointed out from the pleadings in the writ petition that the\\ndetaining authority has taken into consideration three letters one\\nof which is dated 2.2.2002 written by one Ms.J.Bhanu. The said\\nletter states that the petitioner has indulged in heinous crime,\\nhence the police should take all possible steps to get the\\npetitioner punished and to see that he is not released on bail. A\\ncopy of this letter has been furnished to the detenu. The 2nd\\nrespondent in his counter affidavit filed before the Court has\\nstated that he has taken note of the contents of this letter. We\\nfail to see how the contents of this letter in any manner is\\nextraneous or irrelevant for the purpose of forming an opinion\\nas to the detention of the petitioner. The argument of the\\nlearned counsel is that this is not a letter which was either\\nrecovered during the course of investigation or a statement\\nmade to the investigating officer, therefore, such letter from a\\npro bono public is likely to prejudice the mind of the detaining\\nauthority. The learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to\\nsatisfy us that the detaining authority is not entitled to look into\\nany material which is not collected during the course of the\\npolice investigation, even though such material may be relevant\\nfor the purpose of forming a subjective satisfaction. From the\\ncontents of this letter, we find these are related to the grounds\\nof detention, therefore, we cannot accept this contention of the\\npetitioner also.\\nThe next argument of the learned counsel with regard to\\nthe consideration of extraneous material is that, the detaining\\nauthority has considered two other letters one of which is dated\\n14.2.2002 written by one Mrs.Saraswathi and another letter\\ndated 1.1.2002 written by Dr.S.Nagalakshmi to the policehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 5\\nauthorities. The signatories of these letters claiming to be office\\nbearers of certain women’s organisations had pleaded with the\\npolice authorities to take steps to see that the petitioner is not\\nreleased on bail and if the police authorities failed to do so, the\\nmembers of their association would go on ’Dharna’. In the\\ncounter affidavit filed by the detaining authority, he has stated\\nthat he has not taken into consideration the contents of this\\nletter. The learned counsel for the petitioner argues that if these\\nletters are not considered by the detaining authority then supply\\nof the copies of this letter along with the grounds of detention\\nwould have misled the petitioner in making an effective\\nrepresentation. Therefore, the detention should be held to be\\ninvalid. We do not accept this argument either. Mere fact that\\ncopies of the some of the materials placed before the detaining\\nauthority was included in the list of documents given to the\\ndetenu ipso facto does not, in any manner, affect the petitioner’s\\nright to make a proper representation against his detention. The\\ncontents of this letter, if at all, read by the detenu would not, in\\nany manner, mislead him or would confuse him because the\\ncontents of this letter are similar to the letter of Ms.Bhanu and it\\nindicates that the police should take steps to prevent the\\npetitioner from coming out on bail. Therefore, these letters\\ncannot, in any manner, cause confusion in the mind of the\\ndetenu. In our opinion, this complaint of the petitioner has to be\\nrejected.\\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner then contended that\\nsome of the documents referred and relied upon in the grounds\\nof detention have not been supplied to the detenu, hence, there\\nis a non-communication of grounds of detention. In support of\\nthis contention the learned counsel relied on the fact that the\\ndetaining authority while passing the order of detention has\\nreferred to the bail application of the petitioner moved before\\nthe 17th M.M.Court, Saidapet, Chennai and also the application\\nfor bail filed by the petitioner before the Principal Sessions\\nCourt which were dismissed by the said courts, copies of these\\naccording to the petitioner, were not supplied to the petitioner\\nbecause of which the petitioner could not make an effective\\nrepresentation. From the perusal of these documents, it is seen\\nthat the detaining authority has made a reference to the same in\\nthe course of narration of fact, and he has not based or founded\\nhis subjective satisfaction on the contents of the said\\ndocuments. Therefore, in our opinion, it is not necessary for the\\ndetaining authority to give copies of these documents which are\\nonly in the nature of narration of facts.\\nThe learned counsel then contended that there is a total\\nnon-communication of grounds and the order of detention\\ninasmuch as the same is supplied to him in a language not\\nknown to the petitioner. He submitted even though some of the\\ncopies of the document in Tamil was furnished to him on his\\ndemand on 28.2.2002 the same was far beyond the required\\ntime period and because of this belated supply of the documents\\nhe was prevented from making an effective representation to\\nthe detaining authority. In this regard, we notice on receipt of\\nthe order and grounds of detention with enclosures, the detenu\\nhad written a letter to the 2nd respondent intimating him of his\\ninability to read and write Tamil. In reply the detaining\\nauthority has denied the same immediately. However, he, along\\nwith the said letter, has supplied the copies of the said\\ndocuments on 28.2.2002. It is true that the detaining authority\\nin the order of detention has mentioned that if the detenu so\\nchooses he may make a representation to him before the\\nconfirming authority, namely, the State Government confirms\\nhis order of detention. The detaining authority in his affidavit\\nbefore this Court has stated that he received the representation\\nof the petitioner and considered and rejected the same onhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 5\\n4.3.2002. Therefore, it is clear that the petitioner had sufficient\\ntime to make a representation to the detaining authority. At this\\nstage, it may be relevant to notice that even though the detenu\\nhad no legal right to make a representation to the detaining\\nauthority, still the same was given to him and he did use this\\nright, which representation was considered at an early date by\\nthe detaining authority and was rejected. By the delay of two\\ndays in furnishing the translated copies to the detenu, there was\\nno prejudice caused to the petitioner in making his\\nrepresentation effectively to the detaining authority.\\nIn the exercise of his constitutional right the petitioner\\nhas made a separate representation to the State Government\\nwell within the time allowed, by which time he had received the\\ntranslated copies. This representation was considered and\\nrejected by the State Government. Though the petitioner\\ninitially questioned the delay in disposal of this representation\\nby the State Government, but after some arguments the learned\\ncounsel did not press this argument further.\\nThe learned counsel then contended that there are some\\nTamil transcripts in the grounds of detention which were not\\ntranslated and given to him when the translated copies of other\\ndocuments were given. We have perused these Tamil\\ntranscripts which indicates the conversation the petitioner had\\nin Tamil with others. The statements of those persons who\\nconversed with the petitioner have been supplied to the\\npetitioner which contains the English translation of these very\\nwords. Therefore, it is futile to contend that non translation of\\nthe actual words spoken by the petitioner himself could have\\nprejudiced the petitioner in making his representation.\\nIt is lastly contended that the State Government was\\nprejudiced by the opinion rendered by the detaining authority.\\nThis argument is built around the fact that the State\\nGovernment sought para wise remark from the 2nd respondent\\nwhile dealing with the petitioner’s representation. In response\\nto that the 2nd respondent while sending his remarks in the last\\npara stated that the petitioner’s representation may be rejected.\\nThis recommendation according to the learned counsel has\\nweighed in the mind of the confirming authority to reject\\npetitioner’s representation. We are unable to accept this\\nargument also. It is normal under the rules of business for the\\nGovernment to seek the remarks of the officer against whose\\norder a representation is made to the Government. As a matter\\nof fact, if such remarks are not called for and statutory\\nrepresentations are rejected summarily by the Government it\\nwould be considered as a rejection without application of mind.\\nTherefore, in cases where the considering authority feels that\\nthe remarks of the officer who made the original order is\\nnecessary then such superior authority must call for such\\nremarks. In the instant case, the representation filed by the\\ndetenu did raise certain factual points which without the\\ncomment of the detaining authority might have been difficult to\\nbe dealt with. Therefore, in our opinion, the authority\\nconsidering the representation had justly called for the remarks.\\nThe next limb of this argument that the State Government was\\ninfluenced by the remarks of the detaining authority to dismiss\\nthe representation is too far fetched. In the instant case, the\\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu has been authorised to be the\\nauthority to consider the representation against the detention\\norder made by the Commissioner of Police who is subordinate\\nto it. Therefore, to presume that such higher authority would be\\ninfluenced by an observation made by the subordinate to such\\nan extent as to surrender its independent authority is to demean\\nthe independence of authority exercised by the State\\nGovernment, hence this argument is recorded here only to be\\nrejected.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 5\\nFor the reasons stated above, this petition fails and the\\nsame is dismissed.',\n",

AZIZUL HAQ & ANR.\\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 14/03/2000\\nBENCH:\\nS.S.M.Quardi, S.Rajendra Babu\\nJUDGMENT:\\nRAJENDRA BABU, J. :\\nLeave granted in S.L.P. (C) Nos. 6767-6768 of 1999.\\nRespondent No. 1 filed a civil suit against the\\nappellant regarding the plot in Civil Suit No. 268 of 1987\\non the ground that the premises is open land and the\\nprovisions of C.P. and Berar Letting of Houses and Rent\\nControl Order, 1949 [hereinafter referred to as the Order]\\nwas not applicable to the said premises and that the tenancy\\nof the appellant stood terminated by efflux of time followed\\nby a notice dated 8th March, 1986 with effect from 1st\\nApril, 1986. The appellant took the stand that the premises\\nin question is not an open plot but is a house as defined in\\nthe Order as the said land is a part and parcel of the\\nresidential house and the residential house cannot be used\\nwithout the said land. Further it was contended that\\npermission to construct a shed had been granted, the open\\nland was no longer an open land as such shed had been\\nconstructed with permission. There is a well also situate\\nin this land which is for the use of the occupants of the\\nhouse in the premises and, therefore, clause 13-A of the\\nOrder would dis-entitle the respondent from obtaining the\\nrelief of a decree. The Civil Judge, Akola, passed a\\ndecree. The appellant preferred an appeal challenging the\\nfindings of the trial court that the premises in possession\\nof the appellant is an open plot and not a house as defined\\nin clause 13 of the Order. On 27th June, 1989 the Order was\\namended by substituting the word premises for the word\\nhouse, wherever it occurs, and by this amendment, sub-\\nclause (4-A) was also inserted in clause 2 whereby lands not\\nbeing used for agricultural purposes also stood included in\\nthe definition of the premises. Thereafter the State of\\nMaharashtra made another amendment which became effective\\nfrom 26th October, 1989 and introduced clause 13-A in the\\nOrder to the effect that no decree for eviction shall be\\npassed in a suit or proceeding filed and pending against the\\ntenant in any court or before any authority unless the\\nlandlord produces a written permission of the Controller as\\nrequired by sub- clause (1) of clause 13. At that stage,\\nthe appellant filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of\\nthe Civil Procedure Code to contend that in view of the\\namendment introduced by insertion of clause 13-A read withhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 5\\nthe definition of premises in clause 2(4-A) the Order\\nstood extended to open plots and, therefore, even on the\\nbasis of the plaint allegations the same was liable to be\\nrejected. In the meanwhile, the respondent filed a Writ\\nPetition before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay,\\nNagpur Bench, challenging the validity of clause 2(4-A) and\\nclause 13-A of the Order on the ground that the same are\\nultra vires Section 2 of the C.P. and Berar Regulation of\\nAccommodation Act, 1947 [hereinafter referred to as the\\nAct]. The High Court stayed the proceedings in the appeal\\npending before the District Court. A Division Bench of the\\nHigh Court declared the said provisions in clause 2(4-A) and\\nclause 13-A of the Order ultra vires the Act. The appellant\\npreferred an appeal by special leave to this Court. This\\nCourt allowed the said appeal and the matter stood remanded\\nto the High Court with a direction that the High Court to\\nrestore to its file the original Writ Petition and to decide\\nthe question with regard to the applicability of clause\\n2(4-A) and clause 13-A of the Order to the facts as\\navailable in the present case and to dispose of the Writ\\nPetition afresh as to the vires of the clauses, if so\\nwarranted. In the meanwhile, Joint District Court, Akola,\\nallowed the appeal filed by the appellant and the suit filed\\nby the respondent No. 1 was dismissed. A revision\\napplication was filed before the High Court questioning the\\ncorrectness of the order made in the appeal which is pending\\nconsideration by the High Court.\\nAfter remand in the writ petition, the High Court took\\nthe view that there was no appeal filed or pending against\\nthe tenant on 26th October, 1989 when the second amendment\\nwas published and hence it has to be inferred that no\\nproceedings are filed or pending against the tenant as on\\nthat date and thus the amendment was not applicable to the\\ninstant case as the tenancy in respect of the open plot was\\ndeemed to have expired immediately on 10th April, 1986 in\\nview of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and the\\nsuit plot was not covered under the provisions of the\\nCentral Provinces and Berar Regulation of Letting of\\nAccommodation Act, 1946 and the suit was decreed. The\\nsecond amendment brought into force on 26th October, 1989\\nwas not applicable to the plot as the same would be\\nprospective and not retrospective. On that basis the High\\nCourt held that clause 2(4-A) and clause 13-A of the Order\\nwould not be applicable to the suit land and disposed of the\\nwrit petition. This order is in challenge before us.\\nA contention has been raised before us that the\\nexpression house would also include land appurtenant to\\nsuch building and, therefore, it is a part of the house and\\neven if the amendment is not held applicable, the High Court\\nshould have examined the question whether the premises in\\nquestion is a house as defined under the Act or not.\\nFurther at the time of hearing, a point, which was put forth\\nbefore us, is that clause 13-A is applicable to a pending\\nappeal even filed by a tenant. On behalf of the appellants\\nreliance is placed on three decisions Amarjit Kaur v.\\nPritam Singh & Ors., 1974 (2) SCC 363; Lakshmi Narayan Guin\\n& Ors. v. Niranjan Modak, 1985 (1) SCC 270, and H. Shiva\\nRao & Anr. v. Cecilia Pereira & Ors., 1987 (1) SCC 258, to\\ncontend that if a rent Act is made applicable during\\npendency of an appeal irrespective of the fact whether the\\nappeal is preferred by the landlord or by the tenant, such\\nappeal would be governed by the Act and its provisions would\\noperate from the date of the filing of the suit and if thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 5\\nsuit filed not in terms of the ground specified in the rent\\nAct, the suit would be incompetent and, therefore, the\\nappeal must be disposed of accordingly. Shri V.A. Mohta,\\nthe learned senior Advocate appearing for the respondents,\\nsubmitted that the Act provides for regulating the letting\\nand sub-letting of accommodation in the State of Madhya\\nPradesh of which Akola town was a part prior to the\\nreorganisation of the States and that the Act is applicable.\\nGovernment under Section 2 of the Act could, by an order,\\nextend by a notification for regulating the letting and\\nsub-letting of any accommodation or class of accommodation\\nwhether residential or non-residential, whether furnished or\\nunfurnished and whether with or without board and, inter\\nalia, providing for preventing the eviction of tenants or\\nsub-tenants from such accommodation in specific\\ncircumstances. Therefore, it was argued that the Order is\\nonly an administrative order and cannot have retrospective\\neffect and relied upon the decisions of this Court to\\nsupport this proposition in The Income Tax Officer, Alleppy\\nv. M.C. Ponnoose & Ors. etc., 1969 (2) SCC 351; The\\nCannanore Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. v.. Collector of\\nCustoms and Central Excise, Cochin & Ors., 1969 (3) SCC 112,\\nand Bakul Cashew Co. & Ors. v. Sales Tax Officer, Quilon\\n& Anr., 1986 (2) SCC 365. It was further contended that the\\naccommodation would only mean a residential or dwelling\\nhouse and can never mean open plot of land; that the\\ndefinition of house could not have been replaced by\\npremises and, therefore, the said provision is ultra\\nvires. It was further submitted that the appeal was filed\\nonly against the decree and thus the bar under clause 13-A\\nwas only in respect of passing of a decree and inasmuch as a\\ndecree had already been passed, it would not be applicable\\nto a proceeding in an appeal or a revision petition. Shri\\nA.K. Sanghi, the learned counsel for the respondents,\\nadopted these arguments of Shri Mohta as to the\\ninterpretation of the provisions and added by submitting\\nthat there had been a surrender of the premises which,\\nhowever, was not supported by any material on record.\\nThe vires of the provisions are not in issue before\\nus. Now what we have to consider in this proceeding is\\nwhether the provisions of clause 13-A would be applicable to\\nthe present case or not. The High Court proceeded on the\\nbasis that there is no appeal filed or pending against the\\ntenant on 26th October, 1989 when the amendment came into\\nforce and, therefore, it has to be inferred that no\\nproceedings were filed or pending against the tenant as on\\nthat date. This view of the High Court does not take note\\nof the language of clause 13-A of the Order. The effect of\\na decree passed by a court against which an appeal is filed\\nhas been considered in Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar\\nLal Chaudhuri, 1940 FCR 84, wherein the Federal Court\\nexplained that once a decree passed by a court has been\\nappealed against the matter became sub-judice again and\\nthereafter the appellate court acquired seisin of the whole\\ncase. It has been a principle of legislation in India at\\nleast from 1861 onwards that a court of appeal shall have\\nthe same powers and shall perform as nearly as may be the\\nsame duties as conferred and imposed on courts of original\\njurisdiction. Such a view was taken even before the Civil\\nProcedure Code was introduced in Kristnama Chariar v.\\nMangammal, 1902, ILR 26 Mad 91, that the hearing of an\\nappeal is under the processual law of the country being in\\nthe nature of a re-hearing and it is on the theory of an\\nappeal being in the nature of a re-hearing that the courtshttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 5\\nin this country have, in numerous cases, recognised that in\\nmoulding the relief to be granted in a case on appeal, the\\ncourt of appeal is entitled to take into account even facts\\nand events which have come into existence after the decree\\nappealed against. As an appeal is a re-hearing, it must\\nfollow that if an appellate court dismisses an appeal it\\nwould be passing a decree affirming eviction and thereby\\npasses a decree of its own, and in the event it upsets the\\ndecree of the trial court, it would be again passing a\\ndecree of its own resulting in merger of decree of the trial\\ncourt with that of the appellate court. In Garikapati v.\\nSubbiah Chowdhry, AIR 1957 SC 540, this Court enunciated\\nthat the legal pursuit of a remedy, suit, appeal and second\\nappeal are really but steps in a series of proceedings all\\nconnected by an intrinsic unity and one to be regarded as\\none legal proceeding.\\nAfter we heard the arguments, the learned counsel for\\nthe respondents circulated a decision Motiram Ghelabhai v.\\nJagan Nagar, 1985 (2) SCC 279, to contend that when a\\nprovision is amended or repealed in respect of a pending\\nsuit the principle that an appeal is a continuation of the\\nsuit, cannot invoked so as to apply to appeals. In that\\ncase, when the appeal was pending, Part II of the Bombay\\nRents, Hotel and Lodging Housing Rates Control Act, 1947 was\\nmade applicable to the area directly covered by the proviso\\nto Section 50 with a separate paragraph added thereto and\\nthe appeal was liable to be decided and disposed of as if\\nthe 1947 Act had not been passed, that is to say, the appeal\\nhad to be disposed of in accordance with the law then\\napplicable to it. Therefore, in those circumstances, this\\nCourt made the observation that the language of Section 50\\nof the 1947 Act read with the proviso thereto was an\\nordinary repealing clause and it was held that the principle\\nthat the appeal is a continuation of the suit could not be\\ninvoked inasmuch as such a provision prevails over a general\\nprovision affording protection to tenants. Otherwise, we\\ncannot reconcile this decision with the three decisions\\nreferred to earlier in this order and relied on by the\\nlearned counsel for the appellants. Hence, the learned\\ncounsel for the respondents cannot derive any support from\\nthis decision.\\nIn theory the appeal is only a continuation of the\\nhearing of the suit. Accordingly, the word suit in the\\nOrder has to be understood to include an appeal. The result\\nis that at the time of the institution of the suit for\\neviction clause 13-A was not in force, but at the time of\\nappeal such a clause is introduced, the tenant in appeal\\nbecomes entitled to its protection. We draw support for\\nthese propositions from the three decisions of this Court\\ncited by the learned counsel for the appellants. Therefore,\\nwe are of the view that the High Court was not justified in\\nholding that there was no appeal filed or pending against\\nthe tenant. In this case, although a decree for eviction\\nhad been passed in the suit, that decree was under challenge\\nin a proceeding arising out of that suit in appeal and was\\npending in a court. Thus an appeal being a re-hearing of\\nthe suit, as stated earlier, the inference drawn by the High\\nCourt that no proceedings were filed or pending against the\\ntenant as on the date would not be correct..\\nThe High Court further concluded that the amendments\\nhave no retrospective effect. The provision came into force\\nwhen the appeal was pending. Therefore, though thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 5\\nprovision is prospective in force, has retroactive effect.\\nThis provision merely provides for a limitation to be\\nimposed for the future which in no way affects anything done\\nby a party in the past and statutes providing for new\\nremedies for enforcement of an existing right will apply to\\nfuture as well as past causes of action. The reason being\\nthat the said statutes do not affect existing rights and in\\nthe present case, the insistence is upon obtaining of\\npermission of the Controller to enforce a decree for\\neviction and it is, therefore, not retrospective in effect\\nat all, since it has only retroactive force.\\nThe problem concerning retrospectivity concerning\\nenactments depends on events occurring over a period. If\\nthe enactment comes into force during a period it only\\noperates on those events occurring then. We must bear in\\nmind that the presumption against retrospective legislation\\ndoes not necessarily apply to an enactment merely because a\\npart of the requisites for its action is drawn from time\\nantecedent to its passing. The fact that as from a future\\ndate tax is charged on a source of income which has been\\narranged or provided for before the date of the imposition\\nof the tax does not mean that a tax is retrospectively\\nimposed as held in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v.\\nThorn Electrical Industries Ltd., 1975 (1) WLR 1661.\\nTherefore, the view of the High Court that clause 13-A is\\nretrospective in effect is again incorrect.\\nThe High Court further took the view that the\\nexpression premises in the Act does not state as to when\\nthe amendment was to be effective as it does not state\\nwhether the amendment was retrospective or prospective. The\\nsame is on the statute book on the date on which the suit or\\nproceeding is pending for purpose of eviction and cannot\\nignore the provision on the statute book. Therefore, the\\nview of the High Court on this aspect of the matter also, is\\nincorrect. The arguments advanced on behalf of the\\nrespondents that these amendments are retrospective in\\ncharacter and could not have been made in the absence of an\\nauthority under the main enactment by virtue which such\\norder is made is untenable.\\nFor the aforesaid reasons, the appeals are allowed,\\nthe order made by the High Court is set aside and the matter\\nis remitted to the High Court for a fresh consideration in\\naccordance with law. There will be no order as to costs.',\n",

The stand of the appellant-\\nUniversity was, as it is now before us, that the appellant-University\\nwill not fall under the definition of Technical Institution as defined\\nunder Section 2(h) of the AICTE Act and consequently, the\\nregulations made for seeking prior approval of the AICTE even by the\\nUniversities to commence a course or programme in technical\\neducation or a new department for the purpose, were in excess of the\\nregulation-making powers of the AICTE and consequently, are null\\nand void and cannot be enforced against the appellant-University to\\nthe extent it obligates even Universities to seek and secure such prior\\napproval from the AICTE.\\nThe learned Single Judge has chosen to accept the stand of\\nthe AICTE by applying and following the ratio of the decision of a Full\\nBench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court reported in M. Sambasiva\\nRao alias Sambaiah & Ors. Vs. Osmania University, Hyderabad\\nrep. By its Registrar & Ors. [1997(1) Andhra Law Times 629] and\\nas a consequence thereof, ordered the cancellation of the admissions\\nmade by the University. When the matter was pursued before a\\nDivision Bench, the learned Judges in the Division Bench also felt\\nconvinced of the ratio laid down by the Full Bench of the Andhra\\nPradesh High Court and rejected the appeal, necessitating the\\nappellant-University to come to this Court. Since the approach\\nadopted by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench are on\\nthe same lines as the one adopted by the Full Bench of the Andhra\\nPradesh High Court, which the Madras High Court has also purported\\nto follow, it would be just and necessary to refer to the said decision\\nand also consider the correctness or otherwise of the ratio in the said\\ndecision.\\nIn M. Sambasiva Rao (supra), while adverting to the relevant\\nprovisions of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956, the\\nAndhra Pradesh State Council for Higher Education Act, the A.P.\\nUniversities Act, 1991, the AICTE Act and the All India Council for\\nTechnical Education (Grant of approval for starting new Technical\\nInstitutions, introduction of courses or programmes and approval of\\nintake capacity of seats for the courses or programmes) Regulations,\\n1994 [hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulations], the High Court\\narrived at a conclusion that the AICTE Act being a special law on a\\nparticular category of education, overrides even the University Grants\\nCommission Act, which, in the opinion of the High Court, was in the\\nnature of a general law in regard to imparting of education by\\nUniversities in general in respect of common matters covered\\nthereunder. In spite of both the Acts being those made by the\\nParliament within its legislative competence even as later law, the\\nAICTE Act was held to be binding. As for the relative operation of the\\nAICTE Act and the State Act dealt with therein, it was held that the\\nAICTE Act occupied the field and that, therefore, the State Act has to\\nyield and consequently statutory regulations made are not only valid\\nand had the force of law as a subordinate legislation, but no question\\nof repugnancy between the Regulations and AICTE Act or any\\nalleged excess exercise of power in framing such regulations, arose\\non the facts of the case having regard to the creation of the AICTE for\\nthe proper planning and coordinated development of technical\\neducation system throughout the country. The Andhra Pradesh High\\nCourt was of the view that anybody or everyone of the authorities and\\ninstitutions concerned with a technical education all over the country\\nwould fall within the meaning of Technical Institution as defined in\\nSection 2(h) of the AICTE Act and, therefore, be bound by the\\nauthority of the AICTE under the AICTE Act and the Regulations\\nmade thereunder. In coming to such conclusions, the Full Bench\\ntried to draw sustenance from the decisions of this Court reported inhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 9\\nUnni Krishnan J.P. Vs. State of A.P. [1993(1) SCC 645] and State\\nof Tamil Nadu Vs. Adhiyaman Educational and Research\\nInstitute and Ors. [1995(4) SCC 104].\\nShri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing for the\\nappellant-University, urged that a university like the appellant as\\ndefined under Section 2 (i) will not fall within the definition of a\\ntechnical institution contained in Section 2 (h) of the AICTE Act and,\\ntherefore, equally stood outside the purview of Section 10 (1) (k) of\\nthe said Act and consequently not obliged to seek for and obtain the\\nprior approval of the AICTE for starting a department or introducing\\nnew courses or programmers. The regulations framed by the AICTE\\nfor the same reason insofar as it obligates even universities to obtain\\nsuch prior approval, cannot be held to be binding or enforceable\\nagainst the appellant by the mere fact that the regulation specifically\\nstates so, notwithstanding the provisions contained in the Act\\nstipulating to the contrary and any regulation so made will be void\\nand unenforceable. It was also urged that the decision of the Full\\nBench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court does not lay down the\\ncorrect position of law and the decisions of this Court relied upon in\\nthe said decision really do not lend any support to the principles\\nultimately laid down therein and, therefore, the Madras High Court\\nought to have considered the issues independently and not followed\\nthe ratio of the Full Bench in M. Sambasiva Raos case (supra). The\\nstrong grievance ventilated on behalf of the appellant is that both the\\nAndhra Pradesh and Madras High Courts have failed to properly\\nconstrue the relevant provisions of the Act, applying the correct\\nprinciples of interpretation and also giving due consideration and\\nweight to the various stipulations contained in Section 10 which made\\nspecific reference wherever the universities also have to adhere to\\nthe provisions of the AICTE Act, Rules and Regulations. It was also\\nurged that no Rules or Regulations inconsistent with the provisions of\\nthe Act could have been either made under the Act or sought to be\\nenforced, legitimately. Strong reliance has also been placed on the\\ndecisions reported in S.K. Singh & Others vs V.V. Giri & another\\n(AIR 1970 SC 2097); D.K. Trivedi & Sons and others vs State of\\nGujarat and others (AIR 1986 SC 1323) as also the very decision in\\nUnni Krishnan, J.P. and others vs State of Andhra Pradesh and\\nothers [(1993) 1 SCC 645] and State of T.N. and another vs\\nAdhiyaman Educational & Research Institute and others [(1995)\\n4 SCC 104] and Medical Council of India vs State of Karnataka\\nand others [(1998) 6 SCC 131].\\nDr. J.P. Verghese, learned counsel for the AICTE, while\\ndrawing sustenance from the reasoning of the judgment under\\nchallenge as well as the Andhra Pradesh case, urged that having\\nregard to the overall functions and powers of the Council under the\\nAct to ensure proper planning and coordinated development of the\\ntechnical education system throughout the country, the qualitative\\nimprovement of such education and regulation and proper\\nmaintenance of norms and standards in the technical education\\nsystem and matters connected therewith envisaged under Section 10\\nof the Act particularly Section 10 (1) (k) read with Section 20 (1) (b) of\\nthe ATE Act, the AICTE will have pervasive control over universities\\nalso and consequently, the prior approval of AICTE has to be\\nobtained by even the universities like any other technical institution\\nfor starting any new department or institute or commencing a new\\ncourse or programme in technical education. The totality of the\\npurpose and scheme, claimed to be underlying the enactment is said\\nto confer such sweeping powers over all functional activities relating\\nto technical education and the universities cannot claim immunity\\nfrom such obligation cast under the Act and the regulations made by\\nthe AICTE. The sheet anchor of support for the respondent seem to\\nbe the decision reported in State of T.N. and another vs Adhiyaman\\nEducational & Research Institute and others (supra) and Jaya Gokulhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 9\\nEducational Trust vs Commissioner & Secretary to Government\\nHigher Education Department, Thiruvanathapuram, Kerala State\\nand another [(2000) 5 SCC 231], in addition to the decision of the\\nAndhra Pradesh High Court.\\nWe have bestowed our thoughtful consideration to the\\nsubmissions made on either side. When the legislative intent is found\\nspecific mention and expression in the provisions of the Act itself, the\\nsame cannot be whittled down or curtailed and rendered nugatory by\\ngiving undue importance to the so-called object underlying the Act or\\nthe purpose of creation of a body to supervise the implementation of\\nthe provisions of the Act, particularly when the AICTE Act does not\\ncontain any evidence of an intention to belittle and destroy the\\nauthority or autonomy of other statutory bodies, having their own\\nassigned roles to perform. Merely activated by some assumed\\nobjects or desirabilities, the Courts cannot adorn the mantle of\\nlegislature. It is hard to ignore the legislative intent to give definite\\nmeaning to words employed in the Act and adopt an interpretation\\nwhich would tend to do violence to the express language as well as\\nthe plain meaning and patent aim and object underlying the various\\nother provisions of the Act. Even in endeavouring to maintain the\\nobject and spirit of the law to achieve the goal fixed by the legislature,\\nthe Courts must go by the guidance of the words used and not on\\ncertain pre-conceived notions of ideological structure and scheme\\nunderlying the law. In the statement of objects and reasons for the\\nAICTE Act, it is specifically stated that the AICTE, was originally set\\nup by a Government resolution as a National Expert Body to advice\\nthe Central and State Governments for ensuring the coordinated\\ndevelopment of technical education in accordance with approved\\nstandards was playing an effective role, but, However, in recent\\nyears, a large number of private engineering colleges and\\npolytechnics have come up in complete disregard of the guidelines,\\nlaid down by the AICTE and taking into account the serious\\ndeficiencies of even rudimentary infrastructure necessary for\\nimparting proper education and training and the need to maintain\\neducational standards and curtail the growing erosion of standards\\nstatutory authority was meant to be conferred upon AICTE to play its\\nrole more effectively by enacting the AICTE Act.\\nSection 2(h) defines ‘technical institution for the purposes of\\nthe Act, as follows:-\\ntechnical institution means an institution, not\\nbeing a University, which offers courses or\\nprogrammes of technical education, and shall\\ninclude such other institutions as the Central\\nGovernment may, in consultation with the\\nCouncil, by notification in the Official Gazette,\\ndeclare as technical institutions\\nSince it is intended to be other than a University, the Act\\ndefines in Section 2(i) ‘University to mean a University defined\\nunder clause (f) of Section 2 of the University Grants Commission\\nAct, 1956 and also to be inclusive of an institution deemed to be a\\nUniversity under Section 3 of the said Act. Section 10 of the Act\\nenumerates the various powers and functions of the AICTE as also\\nits duties and obligations to take steps towards fulfillment of the\\nsame. One such as envisaged in Section 10(1)(k) is to grant\\napproval for starting new technical institutions and for introduction of\\nnew courses or programmes in consultation with the agencies\\nconcerned. Section 23, which empowers the Council to make\\nregulations in the manner ordained therein emphatically and\\nspecifically, mandates the making of such regulations only not\\ninconsistent with the provisions of this Act and the rules. The Act, forhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 9\\nall purposes and throughout maintain the distinct identity and\\nexistence of ‘technical institutions and ‘universities and it is in\\nkeeping tune with the said dichotomy that wherever the University or\\nthe activities of the University is also to be supervised or regulated\\nand guided by the AICTE, specific mention has been made of the\\nUniversity alongside the technical institutions and wherever the\\nUniversity is to be left out and not to be roped in merely refers to the\\ntechnical institution only in Sections 10, 11 and 22(2)(b). It is\\nnecessary and would be useful to advert to Section 10(1)(c),(g),(o)\\nwhich would go to show that Universities are mentioned alongside the\\n‘technical institutions and clauses (k),(m),(p),(q),(s) and (u) wherein\\nthere is conspicuous omission of reference to Universities and\\nreference being made to technical institutions alone. It is equally\\nimportant to see that when the AICTE is empowered to inspect or\\ncause to inspect any technical institutions in clause (p) of sub-section\\n(1) of Section 10 without any reservation whatsoever, when it comes\\nto the question of universities it is confined and limited to ascertaining\\nthe financial needs or its standards of teaching, examination and\\nresearch. The inspection may be made or cause to be made of any\\ndepartment or departments only and that too, in such manner as may\\nbe prescribed as envisaged in Section 11 of the Act. Clause (t) of\\nsub-section (1) of Section 10 envisages the AICTE to only advice the\\nUGC for declaring any institution imparting technical education as a\\ndeemed University and not do any such thing by itself. Likewise,\\nclause (u) of the same provision which envisage the setting up of a\\nNational Board of Accreditation to periodically conduct evaluation of\\ntechnical institutions or programmes on the basis of guidelines,\\nnorms and standards specified by it to make recommendation to it, or\\nto the Council, or to the Commission or to other bodies, regarding\\nrecognition or de-recognition of the institution or the programme. All\\nthese vitally important aspects go to show that the AICTE created\\nunder the Act is not intended to be an Authority either superior to or\\nsupervise and control the Universities and thereby super impose itself\\nupon such Universities merely for the reason that it is imparting\\nteaching in technical education or programmes in any of its\\nDepartments or Units. A careful scanning through of the provisions\\nof the AICTE Act and the provisions of the UGC Act in juxtaposition,\\nwill show that the role of AICTE vis-Ã -vis the Universities is only\\nadvisory, recommendatory and a guiding factor and thereby sub-\\nserve the cause of maintaining appropriate standards and qualitative\\nnorms and not as an authority empowered to issue and enforce any\\nsanctions by itself, except submitting a Report to the UGC for\\nappropriate action. The conscious and deliberate omission to enact\\nany such provision in the AICTE Act in respect of Universities is not\\nonly a positive indicator but should be also one of the determining\\nfactors in adjudging the status, role and activities of AICTE vis-Ã -vis\\nUniversities and the activities and functioning of its departments and\\nunits. All these vitally important facets with so much glaring\\nsignificance of the scheme underlying the Act and the language of the\\nvarious provisions seem to have escaped the notice of the learned\\nJudges, their otherwise well-merited attention and consideration in\\ntheir proper and correct perspective. The ultra activist view\\narticulated in M. Sambasiva Raos case (supra) on the basis of\\nsupposed intention and imagined purpose of the AICTE or the Act\\nconstituting it, is uncalled for and ought to have been avoided, all the\\nmore so when such an interpretation is not only bound to do violence\\nto the language of the various provisions but also inevitably render\\nother statutory authorities like UGC and Universities irrelevant or\\neven as non-entities by making the AICTE a super power with a\\ndevastating role undermining the status, authority and autonomous\\nfunctioning of those institutions in areas and spheres assigned to\\nthem under the respective legislations constituting and governing\\nthem.\\nIn Unni Krishnans case (supra), this Court was not concernedhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 6 of 9\\nwith issues of the nature now sought to be raised and the\\nobservations made therein in the context of disputes pertaining to the\\npowers, rights and extent to which the State Legislature or\\nGovernment could interfere, regulate or prohibit the rights to establish\\nand run professional colleges cannot be taken out of their context and\\npurpose to be pressed into service in this case. As a matter of fact,\\neven this Court, which formulated a scheme to prevent evils of\\ncapitation fees etc., specifically excluded from its purview colleges\\nrun by the Government and the Universities. Equally, the\\nconsideration in Adhiyaman Engineering College case (supra), the\\nquestion was as to the relative scope and extent of control of a\\nprofessional engineering college by the State Government in the\\nteeth of the AICTE Act and the powers exercisable by the AICTE\\nunder the provisions of the said Act, Rules and Regulations made\\nthereunder. The decisions, the correctness of which are under our\\nconsideration in this case, have not kept into consideration before the\\nnature and character of the issues raised in the two decisions of this\\nCourt noticed above before relying upon the observations contained\\ntherein in dealing with the rights of an university constituted under a\\nState enactment, which, apart from the enactment constituting it, is\\ngoverned by the provisions of the UGC Act, also made by the\\nParliament. The decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in M.\\nSambasiva Raos case (supra) has unduly oversimplified and\\nunderscored the status, position, as well as the importance of the\\nUGC by stating that the UGC was concerned only with the object of\\nproviding grants and financial assistance to educational institutions\\nand serving as a recommendatory and regulatory body completely\\nloosing sight of its superior, vital and exclusive role ordained to it by\\nthe Parliament itself as an expert body in regard to Co-ordination\\nand determination of standards in institutions for higher education or\\nresearch and scientific and technical institutions, and the standards\\nof teaching and examination in universities, even in the absence of\\nthe UGC and that too without a proper and comparative consideration\\nof the relative scope and effect of the respective role of the UGC as\\nwell as the AICTE.\\nIt is by now well-settled that Parliament has enacted the\\nUniversity Grants Commission Act, 1956 as well as the AICTE Act,\\n1987 in the purported exercise of the powers envisaged in Entry 66 of\\nList-I of the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution of India, which reads as\\nCo-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for\\nhigher education or research and scientific and technical institutions.\\nIt was permissible for the Parliament to enact a law with the object\\nand aim of co-ordination and determination of standards among a\\nparticular class or category of institutions, which may deal with\\ndifferent kinds of education and research as also scientific and\\ntechnical institutions of different disciplines and specialised branches\\nof even such disciplines. The Parliament, while enacting the AICTE\\nAct, was fully alive to the existence, in full force and effect the\\nprovisions of the UGC Act, 1956, which specifically dealt with the co-\\nordination and determination of standards at university level of\\ninstitutions as well as institutions for higher studies of the category or\\nclass other than but deemed to be universities and yet roped into the\\ndefinition of technical institution only institutions not being a\\nUniversity as defined in Section 2(i). Apart from so defining technical\\nInstitutions so as to be exclusive of University even in empowering\\nthe AICTE to do certain things, special care seems to have been\\nconspicuously and deliberately taken to make specific mention of\\nuniversities, wherever and whenever alone the AICTE was expected\\nto interact with universities and University Departments as well as its\\nconstituent Institutions. In the statement of objects to the AICTE Act,\\nthe evil sought to be curbed was stated to be the coming up\\nindiscriminately of number of private engineering colleges and\\npolytechnics in complete disregard of the guidelines resulting in\\ndiluted standards, unplanned growth, inadequate facilities and lack ofhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 7 of 9\\ninfra-structural facilities in them and not of any anomalies arising out\\nof any university bodies or UGC to even think of either sidelining or\\nsubjugating them by constituting AICTE. The guarded language\\nemployed for the said purpose and deliberate omission to refer to the\\nuniversities in Section 10 (1) (k) of the AICTE Act while empowering\\nAICTE to accord approval for starting new technical institutions and\\nintroduction of new programmes or courses by or in such institutions\\ncannot be ignored to be of any insignificance. A careful analysis of\\nthe various provisions contained in Sections 10,11 and 22 will further\\ngo to show that the role of interaction conferred upon AICTE vis-a-vis\\nUniversities is limited to the purpose of ensuring the proper\\nmaintenance of norms and standards in the technical education\\nsystem so as to conform to the standards laid down by it, with no\\nfurther or direct control over such universities or scope for any direct\\naction except bringing it to the notice of the UGC or other authorities\\nonly, of any lapses in carrying out any directions of the AICTE in this\\nregard, for appropriate action. While stating that autonomy of\\nuniversities should not mean a permission for authoritarian\\nfunctioning, the High Courts by the construction placed by them have\\nvirtually allowed such authoritarianism to the AICTE to such an extent\\nas to belittle the importance and elegant role assigned to the\\nuniversities in the Educational system of the country and rendered\\nvirtually subordinate to the AICTE. In our view, that does not seem\\nto be the object of creating AICTE or passing of the AICTE Act. Such\\nconstruction as has been placed by the Court in M. Sambasiva Raos\\ncase (supra) which found favour of acceptance of the Court in the\\npresent case ought to have been avoided and the same could neither\\nbe said to have been intended or was ever in the contemplation of the\\nParliament nor should the UGC and the universities been relegated to\\na role subordinate to the AICTE. The UGC and universities have\\nalways had and have an accepted and well-merited role of Primacy to\\nplay in shaping as well as stepping up a co-ordinated development\\nand improvement in the standards of education and research in the\\nsphere of education. When it is only Institutions other than\\nuniversities which are to seek affiliation, it was not correct to state in\\nthe decisions under challenge that an University, which cannot grant\\naffiliation to a technical institution, cannot grant the same to itself.\\nConsequently, the conclusions rendered based on the principles for\\nclassifying enactments into ‘general law and ‘special law to keep\\nthem within their respective limits or area of operation are not\\nwarranted and wholly uncalled for and do not merit our approval or\\nacceptance.\\nThe AICTE cannot, in our view, make any regulation in exercise\\nof its powers under Section 23 of the Act, notwithstanding sub-section\\n(1), which though no doubt enables such regulations being made\\ngenerally to carry out the purposes of the Act, when such power is\\ncircumscribed by the specific limitation engrafted therein to ensure\\nthem to be not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act and the\\nrules. So far as the question of granting approval, leave alone prior\\nor post, Section 10(1)(k) specifically confines the limits of such power\\nof AICTE only to be exercised vis-Ã -vis technical institutions, as\\ndefined in the Act and not generally. When the language is specific,\\nunambiguous and positive, the same cannot be over-looked to give\\nan expansive meaning under the pretext of a purposive construction\\nto perpetuate an ideological object and aim, which also, having\\nregard to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the AICTE Act,\\nare not warranted or justified. Therefore, the regulation insofar as it\\ncompels the universities to seek for and obtain prior approval and not\\nto start any new department or course or programme in technical\\neducation (Regulation 4) and empower itself to withdraw such\\napproval, in a given case of contravention of the regulations\\n(Regulation 12) are directly opposed to and inconsistent with the\\nprovisions of Section 10(1)(k) of the Act and consequently void and\\nunenforceable.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 8 of 9\\nThe fact that the regulations may have the force of law or when\\nmade have to be laid down before the legislature concerned do not\\nconfer any more sanctity or immunity as though they are statutory\\nprovisions themselves. Consequently, when the power to make\\nregulations are confined to certain limits and made to flow in a well\\ndefined canal within stipulated banks, those actually made or shown\\nand found to be not made within its confines but outside them, the\\ncourts are bound to ignore them when the question of their\\nenforcement arise and the mere fact that there was no specific relief\\nsought for to strike down or declare them ultra vires, particularly when\\nthe party in sufferance is a respondent to the lis or proceedings\\ncannot confer any further sanctity or authority and validity which it is\\nshown and found to obviously and patently lack. It would, therefore,\\nbe a myth to state that regulations made under Section 23 of the Act\\nhave Constitutional and legal status, even unmindful of the fact that\\nanyone or more of them are found to be not consistent with specific\\nprovisions of the Act itself. Thus, the regulations in question, which\\nthe AICTE could not have made so as to bind universities/UGC within\\nthe confines of the powers conferred upon it, cannot be enforced\\nagainst or bind an University in the matter of any necessity to seek\\nprior approval to commence a new department or course and\\nprogramme in technical education in any university or any of its\\ndepartments and constituent institutions.\\nTo put it in a nutshell, a reading of Section 10 of AICTE Act will\\nmake it clear that whenever the Act omits to cover a ‘University, the\\nsame has been specifically provided in the provisions of the Act. For\\nexample, while under clause (k) of Section 10 only ‘technical\\ninstitutions are referred to, clause (o) of Section 10 provides for the\\nguidelines for admission of students to ‘technical institutions and\\n‘Universities imparting technical education. If we look at the\\ndefinition of a ‘technical institution under Section 2(h) of the Act, it is\\nclear that a ‘technical institution cannot include a ‘University. The\\nclear intention of the Legislature is not that all institutions whether\\nUniversity or otherwise ought to be treated as ‘technical institutions\\ncovered by the Act. If that was the intention, there was no difficulty\\nfor the Legislature to have merely provided a definition of ‘technical\\ninstitution by not excluding ‘University from the definition thereof and\\nthereby avoided the necessity to use alongside both the words\\n‘technical institutions and University in several provisions in the Act.\\nThe definition of ‘technical institution excludes from its purview a\\n‘University. When by definition a ‘University is excluded from a\\n‘technical institution, to interpret that such a clause or such an\\nexpression wherever the expression ‘technical institution occurs will\\ninclude a ‘University will be reading into the Act what is not provided\\ntherein. The power to grant approval for starting new technical\\ninstitutions and for introduction of new courses or programmes in\\nconsultation with the agencies concerned is covered by Section 10(k)\\nwhich would not cover a ‘University but only a ‘technical institution.\\nIf Section 10(k) does not cover a ‘University but only a ‘technical\\ninstitution, a regulation cannot be framed in such a manner so as to\\napply the regulation framed in respect of ‘technical institution to\\napply for Universities when the Act maintains a complete dichotomy\\nbetween a ‘University and a ‘technical institution. Thus, we have to\\nfocus our attention mainly to the Act in question on the language\\nadopted in that enactment. In that view of the matter, it is, therefore,\\nnot even necessary to examine the scope of other enactments or\\nwhether the Act prevails over the University Act or effect of competing\\nentries falling under Entries 63 to 65 of List-I vis-Ã -vis Entry 25 of List-\\nIII of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.\\nThe fact that initially the syndicate of the appellant-university\\npassed a resolution to seek for approval from AICTE and did not\\npursue the matter on those lines thereafter or that the other similarhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 9 of 9\\nentities were adopting such a course of obtaining the same and that\\nthe Andhra Pradesh High Court in M. Sambasiva Raos case (supra)\\ntaken a particular view of the matter are not reasons which can be\\ncountenanced in law to non-suit the appellant. Nor such reasons\\ncould be relevant or justifying factors to draw any adverse finding\\nagainst and deny relief by rejecting the claims of the appellant-\\nuniversity. We also place on record the statement of the learned\\nsenior counsel for the appellant, which, in our view, even otherwise is\\nthe correct position of law, that the challenge of the appellant with\\nreference to the Regulation in question and claim of the AICTE that\\nthe appellant-university should seek and obtain prior approval of the\\nAICTE to start a department or commence a new course or\\nprogramme in technical education does not mean that they have no\\nobligation or duty to conform to the standards and norms laid down\\nby the AICTE for the purpose of ensuring co-ordinated and integrated\\ndevelopment of technical education and maintenance of standards.\\nFor all the reasons stated above, we allow the appeal and\\nconsequently set aside the judgment under challenge by dismissing\\nthe writ petition filed in the High Court. Having regard to the position\\nof law declared by us, the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court\\nreported in M. Sambasiva Raos case (supra) cannot also be\\nconsidered to lay down the correct position of law. No costs.\\nJ.\\n[ S. Rajendra Babu ]\\nJ.\\n[ Doraiswamy Raju ]\\nSeptember 24, 2001.',\n",

Thereafter on\\nsuccessful completion of probation they have been duly confirmed on\\ntheir posts.\\nAggrieved by this regularisation, respondent Nos. 3 to 12 filed O.A.\\nNo.1430/92 before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench,\\nNew Delhi [hereinafter referred to as ’the Tribunal’] and sought for a\\ndirection to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to fill up the regular Group C post\\nof Technician Grade II only from their rank at least from the date their\\njuniors were appointed or considered in those posts. In this application,\\nappellants were not made parties. During the pendency of this\\napplication, another application [O.A.No.2095/93] was filed seeking\\nquashing of the regularisation of the appellants as well as some of the\\nrespondents as Technician Grade II and to promote them in their place.\\nThe Tribunal allowed both the applications [O.A.No.1430/92 and\\nO.A.No.2095/93] and directed respondent Nos.1 and 2 to consider the\\ncases of respondent Nos.3 to 12 for promotion to Technician Grade\\nII/Grade C post and promote them to that from the date of promotion ofhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3\\ntheir juniors and fix their inter se seniority by quashing the\\nappointments of the appellants.\\nThe High Court, on writ petition being filed against the same in\\nW.P. 2308/98 dismissed the same and upheld the order of the Tribunal.\\nThe writ petition filed by the appellants as well as that of the CSIR were\\ndismissed. Against the order passed by the High Court in writ petition\\nfiled by CSIR, special leave petition was preferred before this Court,\\nwhich was dismissed by this Court in limine and to those proceedings\\nthe appellants were not parties. The appellants subsequently filed the\\npresent special leave petition and leave was granted by this Court.\\nIt is contended by the appellants which is supported by respondent\\nNos.1 and 2 that at the time of appointment of respondent Nos.3 to 12,\\nonly Group D posts were available and, therefore, they were absorbed\\naccordingly and they could not be considered again for absorption in\\nGroup II/Grade C since they had already derived the benefit of\\nabsorption under the scheme and that absorption also depended upon\\nthe availability of the post at a given point of time. In other words, the\\nseniors stood already absorbed in the lower category. There were no\\nvacancies of a higher scale at the relevant time of subsequent\\nconsideration and hence their case for absorption in promotional grade\\ncould not be reconsidered. It is contended that the appointment of\\nappellants in posts vacant at the relevant point of time, though higher\\nthan those of respondent Nos.3 to 12, is valid in law. It is a matter of\\nchance that at the time of appointment of the appellants, posts in a\\nhigher grade were vacant than at the time of appointment of respondent\\nNos.3 to 12. As respondent Nos.3 to 12 were already absorbed when the\\nTechnician Grade II posts fell vacant, the appellants were given the\\nchance to be appointed in those posts. The appointment was in the\\nnatural course of events and hence cannot be challenged on the ground\\nof arbitrariness or discrimination.\\nThe stand of the contesting respondents is that the absorption\\nmade by the respondents was contrary to rules of seniority. Options\\nhave been called for and given in time by the contesting respondents for\\nthe purpose of considering their cases for promotion or appointment in\\nthose posts. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 were bound to prescribe an\\nobjective and rational method of selection of candidates depending upon\\nthe job requirement and fulfillment of necessary qualifications prescribed\\nfor the post. The fact that consideration has not taken place though the\\ncontesting respondents were within the eligibility zone of promotion and\\npossess necessary and desirable qualification and are senior enough for\\nconsideration of promotion has not been denied. The appointment of\\njunior candidates by pick and choose method without adhering to the\\nprinciple of seniority is unsustainable in law.\\nBoth the appellants and the contesting respondents were serving\\nin the establishment of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on daily wage basis or\\nas casual workers. Respondents 3 to 12 were absorbed in Grade ’D’\\nposts according to their seniority pursuant to a scheme framed by\\nrespondent No.1 for regularization of the services of daily wage workers\\ngiving preference to those who had worked for 240 days in each of the\\ntwo preceding years and were fully qualified. The scheme was\\nintroduced by respondent No.1 on 19th April, 1984 and the selection\\ncommittee selected the candidates for absorption on 25th October, 1985.\\nRespondents 3 to 12 were accordingly absorbed in the year 1985 against\\ngroup ’D’ posts. So far as the appellants are concerned they were\\nabsorbed in different posts under a different scheme framed by\\nrespondent No.1 pursuant to a decision of this Court in WP(C) No.6331\\nof 1988 and were regularized against Group II/C posts on 9th December,\\n1991. It is clear that so far as respondents 3 to 12 are concerned, they\\nhad already been absorbed six years earlier against Group ’D’ posts\\naccording to their seniority and, therefore, the question of considering\\nthem again for absorption under the later scheme did not arise. In facthttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3\\nwhen the appellants were sought to be absorbed against available posts\\nin the establishment in the year 1991, respondents 3 to 12 already stood\\nabsorbed in service and hence could not claim benefit under the scheme\\nframed pursuant to the orders of this Court.\\nIt is only by way of concession that a scheme of absorption was\\nframed pursuant to a direction issued by this Court and when there were\\nvacancies of higher scale at the relevant time and they were not serving\\nin those posts consideration of their cases for absorption in that Grade\\ncould not be considered. Further when the absorption of the appellants\\ncame up for consideration the posts were available in Group II/Grade C\\nand, therefore, the cases of respondent Nos.3 to 12 could not again be\\nconsidered. In those circumstances, absorption of the appellants in\\nGroup II/Grade C cannot be faulted with. Though the Tribunal has\\nthought fit to give a direction to consider the cases of respondent Nos.3\\nto 12 for promotion to the higher scale, the cases of the appellants were\\nconsidered not by way of promotion but by way of absorption in those\\nposts. Hence we do not think the matters that have become final so far\\nas respondent Nos.3 to 12 were concerned could be reopened and if that\\nprocess goes on every time a person has to be absorbed in the service\\nthose who have been absorbed earlier will have to be considered again\\nwhen the higher post becomes available and in such an event, the\\nprocess cannot be completed.\\nIn that view of the matter, we allow this appeal, set aside the\\norders made by the High Court and that of the Tribunal and dismiss the\\napplications filed by respondent Nos.3 to 12 before the Tribunal. No\\ncosts.\\nI.A.Nos.2-3 in SLP(C) No.18382/1999\\nIn the light of the order we have made in C.A.No.2935/2000, it is\\nunnecessary to deal with the relief sought for in I.A.Nos. 2-3 in SLP(C)\\nNo.18382/1999.

MEENA W/O BALWANT HEMKE\\nVs.\\nRESPONDENT:\\nTHE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA\\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 17/04/2000\\nBENCH:\\nDoraiswamy Raju, R.C.Lahoti\\nJUDGMENT:\\nRaju, J.\\nThe appellant in this appeal, who was working as\\nRevenue Record Keeper (Senior Clerk) in the Collectorate at\\nWardha District, was charged before the Special Judge,\\nWardha, of the offences punishable under Section 161, IPC,\\nand Sections 5(1)(d) read with Section 5(2) of the\\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1947 [hereinafter referred to\\nas ‘‘The Act]. The case of the prosecution was that the\\nappellant demanded and accepted on 20.8.1986 a sum of\\nRs.20/- from one Magorao Tarale (PW-1), as gratification\\nother than legal remuneration for doing an official act of\\nsending the relevant records to the copying section for\\nproviding copies of maps and Khasra Patrak, applied for by\\nhim. The appellant pleaded not guilty and sought for trial.\\nThe prosecution examined PWs 1 to 7 and marked several\\ndocuments in support of the charges. The appellant denied\\nthe charges and asserted that she was falsely implicated on\\nthe machinations of PW-3, PW-1 and one Jagdish Bokade, Shri\\nDevanand was examined as DW-1. The crux of the prosecution\\ncase, leaving aside the unnecessary details is that PW-1\\nmade an application on 13.8.86 for copies of records\\nrelating to lands held by his grand father and on the\\nsuggestion of PW-3, the Head Copyist, he approached the\\naccused and requested her to make available the relevant\\nrecord for preparation of copies. The accused, allegedly\\ndemanded Rs.20/- for making available the records. PW-1 was\\nnot prepared to pay the money and he sought the advise of\\none Jagdish Bokade who gave the idea of complaining to the\\nAnti-Corruption Bureau. On receipt of a complaint from\\nPW-1, orally PW-6 reduced the same in writing. Then\\nInspector, PW-6 called for two panchas PWs 2 and 5 from the\\nForest Department as well as a lady constable named\\nVictoria. A pre-trap panchnama was stated to have been\\ndrawn after explaining the details of the trap and the\\ncharacteristics of phenolphthalein powder as well as its use\\nin a trap. PW-1, the complainant was said to have produced\\na currency note of the denomination of Rs.20/- before PW-6\\nwho applied the chemical powder on either side of the\\ncurrency note and made it kept in the side pocket of the\\ntrouser of the complainant. PW-1 was instructed not to\\ntouch the currency note till the accused makes the demand\\nand only thereafter give it to her. PW-2, one of the panch\\nwitnesses, was instructed to accompany the complainant andhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 5\\nnot only hear the conversation between the accused and the\\ncomplainant but also keep a watch as to where the accused\\nkeeps the amount, after receiving the same. The other panch\\nwitness, PW-5 and the lady constable Victoria were\\ninstructed to remain present nearby the side of the record\\nroom and rush to the spot on receipt of the signal from the\\ncomplainant. The lady constable was instructed to\\nimmediately catch the hands of the accused and the rest of\\nthe trap party would follow them by remaining at a distance.\\nThe complainant was said to have gone ahead with PW-2,\\nwhile the other members of the trap party took positions\\noutside the room waiting for the agreed signal from the\\ncomplainant of rubbing his mouth with his handkerchief. The\\nfurther case of the prosecution is that things happened the\\nway it was planned and the complainant not only paid the\\namount by handing over the currency note on a demand then\\nmade by the accused but he came out of the room and made the\\nsignal for the trap party to play their respective and\\nallotted roles. The lady constable was said to have arrived\\nfirst, immediately and held both the hands of the accused\\nwho by then seems to have thrown the currency note from her\\nhands on the table. Thereafter, PW- 6 prepared a solution\\nof sodium carbonate in a glass tumbler and when the accused\\ndipped her hands in the glass tumbler containing the\\nsolution the colour of the solution was said to have turned\\nto purple and the collection of the same was sealed for\\nbeing sent to chemical analyser. The solution of sodium\\ncarbonate when sprinkled on the currency note and the pad on\\nthe table on which the currency note has been thrown purple\\ncolour appeared on both and they were duly seized under a\\nmahazar, for further action. Immediately, thereafter, PW-6\\nwas said to have lodged a report against the accused at\\nPolice Station, Wardha, and thereafter carried on the\\ninvestigation which resulted in laying of the charge against\\nthe accused.\\nThe Special Judge, after considering the materials on\\nrecord, held the charges proved and sentenced the appellant\\nto undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one week\\nand to pay a fine of Rs.200/-, in default of which to suffer\\nfurther rigorous imprisonment for fifteen days for the\\noffence under Section 161, IPC. For the offence under\\nSection 5(1)(d) read with Section 5(2) of the Act, the\\nappellant was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for\\na period of one month and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-, and in\\ndefault to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for three\\nweeks. Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently,\\non 30.10.1993.\\nOn an appeal filed before the High Court at Mumbai, a\\nlearned Single Judge also affirmed the findings recorded by\\nthe Trial Judge. On the question of sentence also, the\\nlearned Judge in the High Court was of the view that\\nleniency had already been shown by the Trial Judge and there\\nwas no further scope for interference. The appeal came to\\nbe rejected on 18.10.1994 resulting in filing of this appeal\\nby special leave.\\nThe learned counsel appearing for the appellant\\nstrenuously contended that the courts below committed grave\\nerrors of law in returning a finding of guilt on the\\nperfunctory materials on record and that no court expected\\nto objectively analyse and evaluate evidence reasonably and\\nrationally could have held the charges proved. It was urgedhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 5\\nthat necessary and essential ingredients to constitute\\noffences as statutorily defined could not be held to have\\nbeen proved. The non-examination of the lady Constable, who\\nfirst reached the spot after the alleged acceptance of the\\namount as well as of Jagidsh Bokade, who had played a\\npivotal role in the trap alongwith PW-1 and PW-3, renders\\nthe case of the prosecution self-condemned.\\nThe learned counsel, at length, took us through the\\nevidence of PW-1, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5 and DW-1 to substantiate\\nthe grievance of the appellant. Reading the evidence of\\nPW-1, it was endeavoured to show that he had spoken\\naltogether a different version in the departmental\\nproceedings against the appellant where he deposed in\\nrespect of the very incident earlier on 30.9.1987 rendering\\nhim totally an unreliable witness and his evidence\\nuncreditworthy. The controversy in respect of the manner of\\nhanding over the currency and its receipt was said to have\\nbeen belittled and ignored when, according to the learned\\ncounsel, it cuts at the very root of the vital ingredient of\\nacceptance of the money itself and on the other hand\\nsufficiently proved the claim that PW-1 only attempted to\\nthrust the currency into the hands of the appellant and when\\nthe appellant refused the same by pushing with her hand, not\\nonly the currency note came into contact with her hand but\\nin the process fell on the pad on the table from where only\\nit was taken and seized. The several admissions made by\\nPW-1 and PW-3 were said to substantiate the position that\\nthey and one Jagdish Bokade, who was the author of the\\napplication submitted on 13.8.1986 and who was with PW-1 all\\nthrough, were in hand in glove in this venture to harass the\\nappellant since the staff in the Collectorate, particularly\\nPW-3, did not like the appellant to be in the Collectorate\\nand that they were offended on account of the refusal of the\\nappellant to participate in the periodical liquor parties\\nheld by them by making contribution, as desired. Finally,\\nit was submitted that the materials on record are not safe\\nto be relied upon or sufficient in law to condemn the\\nappellant of the offences of the nature levelled against\\nher.\\nThe learned counsel for the respondent-State, while\\nstrongly placing reliance upon the judgments of the courts\\nbelow, contended that the concurrent findings of the courts\\nbelow, recorded on a proper appreciation of the evidence, do\\nnot suffer from any infirmities or irregularities, to call\\nfor an interference in this appeal and that, therefore, the\\nappeal does not merit our acceptance. Our attention has\\nbeen drawn to such findings of the trial court, which were\\nin extenso quoted and approved by the learned judge in the\\nHigh Court also, in support of his stand.\\nThe essential ingredients to be established to indict\\na person of an offence under Section 5(1)(d) of the Act are\\nthat he should have been a public servant; that he should\\nhave used corrupt or illegal means or otherwise abused his\\nposition as such public servant, and that he should have\\nobtained a valuable thing or pecuniary advantage for himself\\nor any other person. Likewise, Section 161, IPC, requires\\nthat the person accepting the gratification should be a\\npublic servant; that he should accept the gratification for\\nhimself and the gratification should be as a motive or\\nreward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for\\nshowing or forbearing to show, in the exercise of his\\nofficial function, favour or disfavour to any person. Likehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 5\\nany other criminal offence, the prosecution has to prove the\\ncharge beyond reasonable doubt and accused should be\\nconsidered innocent, till it is established otherwise by\\nproper proof of acceptance of the illegal gratification, the\\nvital ingredient, necessary to be established to procure a\\nconviction for the offences under consideration.\\nWe have bestowed our careful thought to the\\nsubmissions made on either side, in the light of the\\nevidence on record. We are of the view that neither the\\nquality of the materials produced nor their proper\\nevaluation could, in this case, be held sufficient to\\nconvince or satisfy the judicial conscience of any\\nadjudicating Authority to record a verdict of guilt, on such\\nslender evidence. Indisputably, the currency note in\\nquestion was not recovered from the person or from the table\\ndrawer, but when the trap party arrived was found only on\\nthe pad on the table and seized from that place only. The\\nquestion is as to whether the appellant accepted it and\\nplaced it on the table or that the currency note fell on the\\npad on the table in the process of the appellant refusing to\\nreceive the same by pushing away the hands of PW-1 and the\\ncurrency, when attempted to be thrust into her hands. PW-2,\\none of the panch witnesses, who accompanied PW-1, as a\\nshadow witness, when he tried to give the bribe, did not\\nsupport the prosecution case. He has been treated hostile\\nand his evidence eschewed from consideration by the courts\\nbelow. The lady Constable, Victoria, another shadow\\nwitness, who first arrived on the spot after the signal was\\ngiven by PW-1, was not examined at the trial. Law has\\nalways favoured the presence and importance of a shadow\\nwitness in the trap party, not only to facilitate such\\nwitness to see but also overhear what happens and how it\\nhappens also. In this case, the role of Victoria was to\\nenter first and hold the hands of the accused immediately\\nafter the acceptance of the bribe amount and she was stated\\nto have done that, as planned. For reasons best known, such\\na vital and important witness has been withheld by the\\nprosecution, from being examined. Jagdish Bokade, who\\nscribed the application dated 13.8.1986 for getting copies\\nand who admittedly was all alongwith PW-1 and gave even the\\nidea of lodging a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Bureau,\\nhas also been withheld from being examined. The other\\nperson, who was present at the place of occurrence though\\ncited initially as witness, was not examined by the\\nprosecution but later was got examined as DW-1 and evidence\\nof this person completely belies the prosecution story. The\\ncorroboration essential in a case like this for what\\nactually transpired at the time of the alleged occurrence\\nand acceptance of bribe is very much wanting in this case.\\nEven the other panch witness, PW-5, categorically admitted\\nthat even as the Inspector of Police, PW-6, arrived, the\\nappellant gave the same version that PW-1 tried to force\\ninto her hands the currency note which she turned down by\\npushing it away, and his evidence also does not lend\\ncredibility to the case of the prosecution. The\\ncontradictory version of PW-1 of the very incident when\\nearlier examined in departmental proceedings renders his\\ntestimony in this case untrustworthy. PW-3, the Head\\nCopyist, seems to be the brain behind all these and that\\nPW-1 as well as Jagdish Bokade appear to be working as a\\ngroup in this affair and despite the blunt denial by PW-3,\\nhis closeness to PW-1 and Jagdish Bokade stand well\\nsubstantiated. All these relevant aspects of the case seem\\nto have been completely overlooked by the courts below.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 5\\nThe learned Judge in the High Court seems to have\\nmechanically affixed his approval to the findings recorded\\nby the trial Judge by profusely extracting such findings.\\nMere recovery of the currency note of Rs.20/- denomination,\\nand that too lying on the pad on the table, by itself cannot\\nbe held to be proper or sufficient proof of the acceptance\\nof the bribe, in the peculiar circumstances of this case\\nwhich lend also credence to the case of the appellant that\\nit fell on the table in the process of the appellant pushing\\nit away with her hands when attempted to be thrust into her\\nhands by PW-1. The results of phenolphthalein test, viewed\\nin the context that the appellant could have also come into\\ncontact with the currency note when she pushed it away with\\nher hands cannot by itself be considered to be of any\\nrelevance to prove that the appellant really accepted the\\nbribe amount. With such perfunctory nature of materials and\\nthe prevaricating type of evidence of PW- 1 and PW-3, who\\nseem to have strong prejudice against the appellant, it\\nwould be not only unsafe but dangerous to rest conviction\\nupon their testimony. PW-1, if really was keen on getting\\nthe copy of the record urgently, could have made an urgent\\napplication to have them delivered within 3 days instead of\\nmaking an ordinary application and going on such an errand,\\nwhich makes it even reasonable to assume that the trio of\\nPW-1, PW- 3 and Jagdish Bokade were attempting to weave a\\nweb around the appellant to somehow get her into trouble and\\nvictimise her.\\nThe fact that the judgments of the courts below were\\nrendered concurrently cannot dissuade us from interfering in\\na case like this where such findings and conviction have\\nbeen recorded on mere conjectures and erratic evaluation of\\nthe evidence on record. Consistency for the mere sake of it\\nis no virtue. It is an obligation of judicial conscience to\\ncorrect errors, where the same are manifest. The judgments\\nof the courts below suffer from serious infirmities and\\nmanifest errors on account of unwarranted inferences\\nliberally drawn by the courts below against the appellant,\\noverlooking the fundamental principle of presumption of\\ninnocence of an accused till the charge levelled and his\\nguilt is established beyond all reasonable doubt. The\\ncourts below have failed to consider the adverse impact on\\nthe prosecution case from the evidence of PW-2 and the\\nwithholding of the lady constable and Jagdish Bokade, two\\nmaterial witnesses. The appellant cannot be, on the basis\\nof available evidence, held to have tacitly accepted the\\nillegal gratification as alleged. The materials on record\\nin this case are not sufficient to bring home the guilt of\\nthe appellant. Consequently, the appeal is allowed. The\\nconviction and sentence of the appellant is set aside and\\nthe fine, if any, paid shall be refunded to the appellant.',\n",

Anis who is appellant in Criminal Appeal No.\\n630 of 2001 were tried and convicted by the trial court. Surendra Singh\\nRautela was convicted under Sections 302 and 307 of the Penal Code\\nand sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life on both counts.\\nHe was further convicted under Section 27(3) of the Arms Act and\\nawarded death sentence and the matter was referred to the High Court for\\nconfirmation of death sentence.

The sentences awarded against\\nthe appellants were, however, ordered to run concurrently. Both the\\naccused persons preferred separate appeals before the High Court\\nchallenging their convictions whereas on behalf of the State, an appeal\\nwas filed for enhancement of punishment of life imprisonment awarded\\nagainst Mohd.

So far appeal preferred by appellant Surendra Singh Rautela is\\nconcerned, his conviction and sentence under Section 27(3) of the Arms\\nAct have been set aside. Conviction and sentence of this appellant under\\nSection 307 of the Penal Code have been upheld. So far as his conviction\\nunder Section 302 of the Penal Code is concerned, the same has been\\nconfirmed but he has been awarded death penalty.\\nProsecution case, in short, is that on 4th April, 1996 at 10.00\\na.m., the informant Ranjan Singh (PW 7) along with his maternal uncle\\nDhananjay Singh and their bodyguards Shyam Bihari Singh (PW 4) and\\nKaru Singh were going in a Maruti Car to their site where contract work\\nwas going on. Ranjan Singh (PW 7) was driving the Car and Dhananjay\\nSingh was sitting by his side whereas Shyam Bihari Singh (PW 4) andhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 5\\nKaru Singh were sitting on the rear seat of the Car. Shyam Bihari Singh\\nwas holding licensed revolver belonging to Ranjan Singh (PW 7). At about\\n10.20 a.m., when the Car reached near Military Chowk at Booty Road, one\\nblack coloured Yamaha motor cycle, on the rear seat of which, appellant\\nSurendra Singh Rautela was sitting, came from behind at the right side of\\nthe Car and he started firing at Ranjan Singh (PW 7) by a stengun, who\\npushed himself behind. In the meantime, there was also firing from the left\\nside of the Car by a person who was on a scooter. Thereupon, the\\ninformant stopped the Car in front of the traffic post. As a result of firing,\\nRanjan Singh (PW 7) and his maternal uncle Dhananjay Singh got injured.\\nThereafter, the accused persons fled away. At that time, some police\\npersonnel arrived there and brought Ranjan Singh (PW 7) and Dhananjay\\nSingh in injured condition to Rajendra Medical College Hospital where\\ndoctor declared Dhananjay Singh as brought dead. It was stated in the\\nfirst information report that Ranjan Singh (PW 7) could identify the person,\\nwho was driving the motor cycle, on seeing him and other occupants of the\\nCar could identify, the person who was on the scooter and fired from the\\nleft side, on seeing him. Motive for the occurrence as disclosed in the first\\ninformation report was that prior to the incident appellant Surendra Singh\\nRautela had demanded Rs. 2 lakhs from Ranjan Singh (PW 7) as ransom\\non two or three occasions which was refused by him which led to the\\npresent occurrence. Stating the aforesaid facts, fardbayan of Ranjan\\nSingh (PW 7) was recorded by the police in the hospital on the same day\\nat 11.30 a.m. on the basis of which the first information report was drawn\\nup.\\nThe police after registering the case took up investigation and\\non completion thereof submitted charge sheet on receipt whereof, the\\nmagistrate took cognizance and committed the accused persons to the\\ncourt of sessions to face trial. During trial, the prosecution examined\\nfourteen witnesses in all and upon the conclusion of trial, the trial court\\nconvicted and sentenced the appellants whereupon appeals were\\npreferred and the same having been disposed of as stated above, the\\npresent appeals by Special Leave filed on behalf of the accused persons\\nas well as the State are before us.\\nFirst, we proceed to consider ocular version of the occurrence\\nsupported by the informant Ranjan Singh (PW 7). According to the first\\ninformation report and the evidence of this witness, besides him and the\\ndeceased Dhananjay Singh, there were two other occupants of the car,\\nwho were eye witnesses, namely, Shyam Bihari Singh (PW 4) and Karu\\nSingh, out of whom, Karu Singh died during trial, therefore, could not be\\nexamined and Shyam Bihari Singh was examined as PW 4, but as he did\\nnot support the prosecution case, he was declared hostile. Thus, Ranjan\\nSingh (PW 7) remains the solitary eye witness. This witness has received\\ninjuries by firearms on vital parts of the body, as would appear from the\\nevidence of Dr. V.K.Jain (PW 8), who examined this witness on the date of\\noccurrence itself in the hospital where he was admitted. This witness has\\nsupported the prosecution case in all material particulars and his evidence\\nhas been corroborated by Ram Pal Singh (PW 1), Om Prakash (PW 3) and\\nKundan Prakash (PW 5), out of whom, PW1 is his father and PW3 and\\nPW5 are his brothers, who were at their house at 11.00 a.m. in the\\nmorning of the date of occurrence and rushed to the hospital immediately\\nupon receipt of information before whom the informant disclosed about the\\noccurrence and name of appellant Surendra Singh Rautela. These\\nwitnesses were examined by the police on the same day in the hospital.\\nThe medical evidence supports the statement of Ranjan Singh (PW 7) as\\nDr. A.K.Choudhary (PW 6), who held postmortem examination on the dead\\nbody of Dhananjay Singh on the date of occurrence itself at 4.00 p.m.,\\nfound injuries by firearm and opined that death was caused between three\\nto eighteen hours at the time of postmortem examination which fits in with\\nthe prosecution case. That apart, the doctor recovered a bullet from the\\ndead body which was sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory where it\\nwas examined by Ezaj Ahmad Khan (PW 12), Deputy Director, Ranchi\\nRegional Forensic Science Laboratory, who opined that bullet was firedhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 5\\nfrom 9 mm caliber and on the statement of accused Surendra Singh\\nRautela made before the police, firearms including 9 mm. Caliber were\\nrecovered by the Police Officer, PW.14, from steel almirah in the premises\\nof ceramic factory on key being produced by the accused himself. Shri\\nP.S. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant\\nSurendra Singh Rautela submitted that no reliance should be placed upon\\nthe testimony of Ranjan Singh (PW 7) as the prosecution case has not\\nbeen supported by another eye witness Shyam Bihari Singh (PW 4), who\\nhas been declared hostile. In our opinion, in view of the fact that Ranjan\\nSingh (PW 7) is an injured person and his evidence is corroborated by\\nPWs 1, 3 and 5 and the medical evidence, we cannot discard his evidence\\nmerely because another eye witness Shyam Bihari Singh (PW 4) has not\\nsupported the prosecution case.\\nShri Mishra submitted that the prosecution has failed to prove\\nthe motive which has been disclosed in the first information report as no\\nevidence has been led to prove the same. In our view, the submission has\\nbeen made only to be rejected as the motive has been proved by the three\\nwitnesses, namely, Ram Pal Singh (PW 1), Om Prakash (PW 3) and\\nKundan Prakash (PW 5). Ram Pal Singh (PW 1), who is father of the\\ninformant, stated that two or three times, telephone calls were received in\\nhis presence from appellant Surendra Singh Rautela demanding Rs. 2\\nlakhs as ransom from the informant. He has further stated that on one\\noccasion, he also received a telephonic call from appellant Surendra Singh\\nRautela demanding ransom. Om Prakash (PW 3), who is brother of the\\ninformant has stated that the cause of incident was that Surendra Singh\\nRautela had demanded a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs from the informant. Kundan\\nPrakash (PW 5), who is another brother of the informant, stated that PW.7\\ntold him that cause of incident was refusal to meet the demand of ransom\\nof appellant Surendra Singh Rautela by the informant.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant Surendra Singh Rautela\\nnext submitted that identification of this appellant by Ranjan Singh (PW 7)\\nwas highly improbable as this witness had seen him prior to the\\noccurrence only once. This witness has stated in his evidence that five to\\nsix days before the incident, he was introduced to appellant Surendra\\nSingh Rautela by Shyam Bihari Singh (PW 4) in Ganga Ashram Hotel at\\nKachcheri Road where they had gone for taking snacks. Since the\\nincident had taken place in broad day light and as this appellant was\\nintroduced to this witness in the hotel, we do not find any improbability in\\nidentification of appellant Surendra Singh Rautela by him.\\nShri Mishra further submitted that the High Court was not\\njustified in enhancing the punishment awarded against this appellant from\\nimprisonment for life to death sentence as no appeal under Section 377 of\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the\\nCode) was filed by the State for enhancement of sentence. It has been\\nfurther submitted that no opportunity of hearing was afforded to appellant\\nSurendra Singh Rautela against the enhancement of sentence. It is well\\nsettled that the High Court, suo motu in exercise of revisional jurisdiction,\\ncan enhance the sentence of an accused awarded by the trial court and\\nthe same is not affected merely because an appeal has been provided\\nunder Section 377 of the Code for enhancement of sentence and no such\\nappeal has been preferred. Reference in this connection may be made to\\ndecisions of this Court in the cases of Nadir Khan v. The State (Delhi\\nAdministration) AIR 1976 SC 2205 and Eknath Shankarrao Mukkawar\\nv. State of Maharashtra AIR 1977 SC 1177. It has been also settled by\\nthis Court in the cases of Jayaram Vithoba and another v. The State of\\nBombay AIR 1956 S.C.146 and Bachan Singh and others v. State of\\nPunjab AIR 1980 SC 267 that the suo motu powers of enhancement under\\nrevisional jurisdiction can be exercised only after giving opportunity of\\nhearing to the accused. In the case on hand, undisputedly, no opportunity\\nof hearing was given to the appellant Surendra Singh Rautela on the\\nquestion of enhancement of sentence.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 5\\nThus, in view of the foregoing discussions, we are of the view\\nthat the High Court was quite justified in upholding conviction of appellant\\nSurendra Singh Rautela under Sections 302 and 307 of the Penal Code\\nbut was not justified in enhancing the sentence of life imprisonment\\nawarded under Section 302 of the Penal Code into death penalty.\\nTurning now to the case of appellant Mohd. Anis, it may be\\nstated that his conviction is based upon the solitary evidence of his\\nidentification by Ranjan Singh (PW 7) in Court as well as in the test\\nidentification parade. Even according to prosecution case as disclosed in\\nthe first information report as well as the evidence of Ranjan Singh (PW\\n7), this appellant was sitting on rear seat of the scooter which came from\\nleft side of the car and fired at the victims. In the first information report, it\\nhas been specifically stated that the associates of the informant who were\\nin the Car could identify this appellant, who fired from the scooter, on\\nseeing him and the informant could identify the person who was driving the\\nmotor cycle on seeing him and on which motor cycle accused Surendra\\nSingh Rautela was sitting on the rear seat and fired at the victims. From\\nthe aforesaid statement of the informant in the first information report, it\\nwould appear that he could not identify appellant Mohd. Anis even by face\\nand for the first time in the Sessions Court, the witness identified him. In\\nview of the aforesaid statement in the first information report, the\\nidentification of the appellant Mohd. Anis by Ranjan Singh (PW 7) in the\\ntest identification parade becomes farce and no reliance can be placed\\nupon his identification in Court. This being the position, we have no option\\nbut to hold that the High Court was not justified in upholding convictions\\nand sentences awarded against this appellant.\\nAs far as appeal preferred on behalf of the State of Jharkhand\\nis concerned, the same was filed challenging the acquittal of appellant\\nSurendra Singh Rautela by the High Court from the charge under Section\\n27(3) of the Arms Act, but Shri S.B.Sanyal, learned Senior Counsel\\nappearing on behalf of the State submitted that he is not in a position to\\nchallenge the order of acquittal on merit. It appears that in the leading\\njudgment, the learned Judge recorded acquittal of appellant Surendra\\nSingh Rautela from the charge under Section 27(3) of the Arms Act on\\nmerit but in the concurring judgment which is by the learned Chief Justice,\\nacquittal under the aforesaid Section has been recorded on the ground\\nthat it was not permissible in law to try appellant Surendra Singh Rautela\\nsimultaneously for the offences under Sections 302 of the Penal Code as\\nwell as 27(3) of the Arms Act. Learned counsel for the State has objected\\nto recording of acquittal in the concurring judgment on this ground. It has\\nbeen submitted that the learned Chief Justice was not justified in holding\\nthat it was not permissible in law to try appellant Surendra Singh Rautela\\nsimultaneously for the offences under Sections 302 of the Penal Code as\\nwell as 27(3) of the Arms Act as the same is contrary to the provisions of\\nSection 220 of the Code. Sub section (1) of Section 220 of the Code lays\\ndown that if, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the\\nsame transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same\\nperson, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such\\noffence. Sub section (3) of Section 220 of the Code lays down that if the\\nacts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more separate\\ndefinitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are\\ndefined or punished, the person accused of them may be charged with,\\nand tried at one trial for, each of such offences. In the case on hand, the\\nact of firing by appellant Surendra Singh Rautela at the victims\\nconstitutes offences both under the Penal Code as well as Arms Act.\\nUnder the Penal Code, two offences have been disclosed, one under\\nSection 307 of the Penal Code for firing at Ranjan Singh (PW 7) and\\nanother under Section 302 of the Penal Code for firing at Dhananjay\\nSingh, deceased. The act of firing at Dhananjay Singh, deceased, by\\nappellant Surendra Singh Rautela apart from constituting an offence\\npunishable under Section 302 of the Penal Code does constitute an\\noffence punishable under Section 27(3) of the Arms Act. According to the\\nprovisions of Sub section (3) of Section 220 of the Code, if act or acts of anhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 5\\naccused in the same transaction constitute more than one offence under\\ndifferent laws, the person accused of them may be charged with and tried\\nat one trial for each of such offences. Thus, in view of the specific\\nprovisions engrafted under sub section (3) of Section 220 of the Code, we\\nhave no option but to hold that the learned Chief Justice in the concurring\\njudgment was not justified in holding that it was not permissible to try\\nappellant Surendra Singh Rautela simultaneously for offences under\\nSection 302 of the Penal Code as well as Section 27(3) of the Arms Act\\nand the charge under Section 27(3) of the Arms Act was totally\\nsuperfluous.\\nIn the result, Criminal Appeal Nos. 628-29 of 2001 are allowed\\nin part and sentence of death awarded against appellant Surendra Singh\\nRautela @ Surendra Singh Bengali by the High Court under Section 302\\nof the Penal Code is set aside and the sentence of imprisonment for life\\nawarded under that Section by the trial Court is restored while upholding\\nconviction of the appellant under Section 302 of the Penal Code and his\\nconviction and sentence under Section 307 of the Penal Code. Criminal\\nAppeal No. 630 of 2001 is allowed, convictions and sentences awarded\\nagainst appellant Mohd. Anis are set aside and he is acquitted of all the\\ncharges. Appellant Mohd. Anis is directed to be released forthwith, if not\\nrequired to be in custody in connection with any other case. Criminal\\nAppeals arising out of SLP(Crl.)

In the said dispute, appellant\\nNo.2 and his family were supporting Kuljinder Singh. On\\n11.10.1996 the civil case pertaining to the said dispute was\\nlisted before the concerned court and in the said proceedings the\\ndeceased Virsa Singh had obtained an interim order against the\\nsaid Kuljinder Singh. On the date of the incident at about 3.30\\np.m. there was a verbal fight which also led to the parties\\ngrappling with each other but that did not culminate in any\\nserious incident due to the timely intervention of some ladies in\\nthe families. It is the prosecution case that thereafter at about 8\\np.m. the appellants herein along with 3 other accused persons\\ncame in a white Maruti car driven by the second appellant and\\nthe said accused persons got down from the car, raising a\\n’Lalkara’ (challenge) that they would teach the complainant\\nparty a lesson for obtaining stay in regard to the land in\\nquestion. Thereafter, it is stated that the first appellant herein\\nwho was armed with a .12 bore double barrel gun and the\\nsecond appellant who was armed with a rifle along with 3 other\\naccused persons who were armed with ’dangs’ attacked the\\ndeceased Virsa Singh and his younger son Kulwant Singh on\\nthe roof of their house. It is stated that during the said attack the\\nfirst appellant Rachhpal Singh and the second appellant\\nGurmit Singh fired shots from their respective weapons at Virsa\\nSingh and Kulwant Singh, consequent upon which each one of\\nthem received two bullet injuries and died on the spot. Thishttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 7\\nincident in question was witnessed by Ravinder Singh, PW-3,\\nwho is the son of the deceased Virsa Singh and the brother of\\ndeceased Kulwant Singh and Darbara Singh, PW-4, who is the\\nmother’s sister’s husband of PW-3 who resides about a\\nkilometer and a half away from the house of the complainant\\nand was visiting the complainant and his family for returning a\\ntrolley which he had borrowed from them. It is the further case\\nof the prosecution that thereafter PW-3 went to the Police\\nStation at Malout which is about 9 kms. from the place of the\\nincident and lodged a complaint at about 11 p.m. with SHO\\nRanjit Singh which complaint was registered and forwarded to\\nthe jurisdictional Magistrate who received the same by 2.45\\na.m. on 12.10.1996. Immediately after registering the crime\\nunder Sections 302, 148, 149 IPC and Sections 25 and 27 of the\\nArms Act against the named accused, the said SHO took up the\\ninvestigation of the case and proceeded to the place of the\\nincident along with PW-10, Assistant Sub-Inspector, Bohar\\nSingh and others. During the course of the said investigation,\\nthe said Officer recorded the statements of the witnesses and at\\nthe time of the spot inspection he also collected the blood-\\nstained earth which was found underneath the dead bodies of\\nVirsa Singh and Kulwant Singh in the presence of local\\nPanchas. The Investigating Officer also found two empty .12\\nbore cartridge casings which were sealed as also 3 empties of\\n44.40 of the bore rifles found near the dead bodies which were\\nalso sealed separately. During the course of investigation, the\\nInvestigating Officer arrested the said accused persons (except\\nappellant No.1) on 25.10.1996 while they were travelling in a\\nwhite Maruti car bearing No. CHK 8320 driven by the second\\nappellant near the village of Punnu Khera. During the said\\narrest they found Gurmit Singh, appellant No.2, in possession\\nof a rifle of 44.40 bore on his shoulder and 4 live cartridges\\nwhich were seized from his possession by the Investigating\\nOfficer. He also took the car in question into his possession\\nunder Ex. P-Z. It is stated that on statement made by the\\nconcerned accused the Investigating Officer also recovered\\ncertain ’dangs’ from the places disclosed by them. It is the\\nfurther case of the prosecution that on 27.10.1996, the first\\nappellant Rachhpal Singh was traced near the Railway Station\\nof village Kabarwala and at the time of his arrest he was in\\npossession of .12 bore double barrel gun and one belt\\ncontaining 9 live cartridges which was also seized by the\\ninvestigating agency.\\nThe post mortem report and the evidence of Dr. R.\\nS.Randhawa, PW-2, shows that both the deceased persons had\\nlacerated wounds on vital parts of their bodies which had\\nlacerated the lung and the Doctor had opined that the injuries in\\nquestion were anti-mortem and had been caused by the use of\\nfire-arms.\\nLearned Sessions Judge considering the material placed\\nbefore him found the appellants herein and the 3 other accused\\npersons guilty of the offence charged against them and\\nconvicted and sentenced appellant Nos. 1 and 2 herein to death\\nfor offence under Section 302 IPC while other accused were\\nsentenced to life imprisonment. He also sentenced them to\\nvarying terms of imprisonment with fine in regard to other\\noffences and referred the case of appellant Nos. 1 and 2 for\\nconfirmation to the High Court.\\nIt is against this conviction and sentence, Murder\\nReference No.2/99 was lodged before the High Court while\\nCriminal Appeal Nos.130-DB to 132-DB/99 were preferred byhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 7\\nthe convicted accused persons challenging their convictions and\\nsentences. The complainant separately preferred a Criminal\\nRevision No.443/99 praying for compensation under Section\\n357 Cr.P.C. among other reliefs. The High Court as per the\\nimpugned judgment, concurred with the finding of the learned\\nSessions Judge as to the conviction imposed on the appellants\\nherein but came to the conclusion that the imposition of capital\\npunishment was uncalled for since it felt that the case in hand\\nwas not one of those rarest of the rare cases and accordingly\\nreduced the sentence to one of life imprisonment in regard to\\nthese appellants. The High Court on an analysis of the\\nevidence, disagreed with the finding of the Sessions Court as to\\nthe guilt of the 3 other accused persons and acquitted them of\\nthe charge under Section 302 read with 148 IPC. It, however,\\nmaintained the conviction under Section 449 but reduced the\\nperiod of sentence to the period already undergone. While\\nconsidering the claim of the complainant in Criminal Revision\\nNo.443/99 for compensation, the High Court felt that this was a\\nfit case for the exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 357\\nCr.P.C. and directed each of the appellants to pay a sum of Rs.2\\nlacs, totalling Rs.4 lacs as compensation and in default it\\nimposed a default sentence of 5 years’ RI on each of the\\nappellants and directed that the said sentence should run\\nconsecutively with the sentence of life imprisonment.\\nMr. K B Sinha, learned senior counsel appearing for the\\nappellants, very strenuously contended that the courts below\\nerred in placing reliance on the evidence of the alleged eye-\\nwitnesses PWs.3 and 4. He contended that it is clear from the\\nevidence of these 2 witnesses that they could not have seen the\\nincident in question from the place where they were allegedly\\nstanding and their very presence at the place of the incident was\\nhighly improbable because if at all PW-3 was present at the\\nplace of the incident, he being the son of Virsa Singh and\\nbrother of Kulwant Singh would have intervened in the fight.\\nThere being no such attempt on the part of PW-3, it is\\nreasonable to presume that he was not present at the time of the\\nincident. In regard to PW-4, he submitted that though he is\\nrelated to the deceased, he was staying far away from the house\\nof the deceased and his stated reason for being present at the\\nplace of the incident having not been established and he having\\nsmall children with a disabled brother, it was highly improbable\\nthat he would have been visiting the deceased at that late hour\\nin the day. In support of this contention, Mr. Sinha pointed out\\nthat it was the case of PW-4 that he had come to return a trolley\\nwhich he had borrowed from the deceased and nowhere in the\\nevidence it is seen that the prosecution has been able to\\nestablish that any such trolley was in fact there at the residence\\nof the deceased. He also submitted that the recovery of the\\nbullet casing was not recorded in the recovery Mahazar,\\ntherefore, that part of the evidence which connects the\\ndischarge bullet from the weapons recovered from the accused\\ncannot be believed.\\nWhile Mr. Bimal R. Jad, learned counsel representing the\\nState of Punjab submitted that the trial court as well as the\\nSessions Court have very carefully considered the evidence\\nadduced by the prosecution and have cited reasons for\\naccepting the same, therefore, there is no ground for\\ninterference with such findings of the courts below.\\nA perusal of the evidence of the doctor shows that there\\nis some discrepancy in his evidence in regard to the nature of\\nthe injury on the deceased as to whether the edges of the wound\\nwere averted or inverted. But this, in our opinion, is not fatal tohttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 7\\nthe case of the prosecution. The doctor while admitting that\\nthere was some such confusion in his evidence as well as the\\npost mortem report, in our opinion, has clarified the said\\nposition during the course of his examination, though belatedly.\\nFrom the very nature of the wounds found on the body of the\\ndeceased, it is clear that they died of gunshot injuries which is\\nnot seriously disputed. What is being disputed by the learned\\ncounsel is the points of entry and exit which on facts of this\\ncase, would make a very little difference since the other\\nevidence adduced by the prosecution clearly shows that the\\ndeceased died out of gunshot injuries. Some discrepancy as to\\nthe nature of entry and exit on facts of this case would not make\\nthe prosecution case any weaker. It is more so because of the\\nfact that the casings of the bullets which were recovered by the\\nInvestigating Officer were positively proved by the ballistic\\nexpert as of those bullets which were discharged from the\\nweapons recovered from the appellants and these casings\\nhaving been found near the bodies of the deceased on the roof\\nof their house would establish that the deceased died of bullets\\ndischarged from the weapons seized from the appellants. In\\nsuch circumstances, the question of entry or exit of the wounds\\nwould lose its significance if the presence of the accused\\npersons with these weapons at that place and time is otherwise\\nestablished by the prosecution. Herein, we must record that\\nwhile the learned counsel for the appellants is unable to\\nquestion the correctness of the ballistic expert’s opinion, he,\\nhowever, states that there is no evidence to show that the bullet\\ncasings sent to the ballistic expert are actually the same casings\\nthat were found near the dead bodies because the Investigating\\nOfficer in Ex. DA, the spot Mahazar, has not noted that he had\\nrecovered those bullet casings. For this the learned counsel\\nrelied on the entry made in Col.23 of Ex. DA. In the said\\ncolumn under the heading ’Articles found near the dead body’,\\nnothing is entered. Such omission, if any, in our opinion does\\nnot disprove the prosecution case that these bullet casings were\\nfound near the dead bodies and were seized, packed and sent to\\nthe ballistic expert. Because in the evidence of the Investigating\\nOfficer he has in specific terms stated that he found these bullet\\ncasings near the bodies of the deceased and he seized, sealed\\nand sent them to the ballistic expert which statement of the\\nInvestigating Officer is not challenged in the cross-\\nexamination, therefore, mere lack of entry in Col. 23 would not\\nin our opinion make the evidence of the Investigating Officer\\nunder oath which is unchallenged as unbelievable. Therefore,\\nwe reject this argument of the learned counsel and accept the\\nevidence of the prosecution that the casings sent by the\\nInvestigating Officer are of the bullets discharged from the\\nweapons in question.\\nComing to the incident in question, learned counsel\\npointed out from the evidence of PWs.3 and 4 that they had\\nclimbed on the roof of the deceased’s house from entirely a\\ndifferent way than the one taken by the deceased and the\\nassailants. Therefore, it is contended that it is highly improbable\\nthat from the place where these witnesses were standing they\\nwould have been able to witness the incident in question. It is\\nalso pointed out from their evidence that these witnesses were\\nhiding behind parapet wall therefore definitely they could not\\nhave seen the incident in question. Here again we must notice\\nthat though it is true that the witnesses have stated that they\\nwent to the roof from a different direction they were specific in\\ntheir evidence as to the visibility of the place of the incident\\nfrom the place where they were standing. The fact that they\\nwere trying to hide themselves from the assailants would not\\nconclusively establish that they were not able to see the\\nassailants. It is not as if they ran away from the place of thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 7\\nincident or locked themselves in such a manner as not to be\\nable to see the incident. As a matter of fact they did go up to the\\nroof and noticed the incident though they did not make\\nthemselves visible to the assailants. The fact that PW-3 did not\\nintervene in the fight would also, in any manner, make his\\nevidence less acceptable. In our opinion PW-3 being the son of\\nVirsa Singh and residing with him was expected to be present\\nin the normal course because it was a time for dinner. Even\\nPW-4 who was a close relative and who was staying just one\\nand a half kilometers away from the house of the deceased, has\\ngiven good reasons to say why he was present at the place of\\nthe incident. He has stated in his evidence that he had borrowed\\na trolly from the deceased and came to the latter’s house to\\nreturn the same. This evidence cannot be disbelieved merely\\nbecause the Investigating Officer did not notice the trolly in the\\nhouse of the deceased at the time of inquest.\\nHaving carefully considered the evidence produced by\\nthe prosecution and the reasoning of the court below, we do not\\nfind any ground to differ from the same, hence, we reject the\\nchallenge of the appellants made in this appeal as to their\\nconviction and sentence.\\nLearned counsel for the appellants then questioned that\\npart of the judgment by which the High Court had awarded\\nRs.4 lacs compensation in exercise of its power under Section\\n357 Cr.P.C. He first of all submitted that his client did not have\\nany court notice of the revision petition filed by the\\ncomplainant because the same was not actually admitted nor\\nany notice was issued. From the ordersheet of the proceedings\\nof the revision petition it is seen that the court had tagged this\\nrevision petition along with the Reference case as well as the\\ncriminal appeals at the time of admission though no notice was\\nissued. Parties were aware of this petition because arguments\\nwere addressed on this question. Hence, this technical\\nobjection cannot be entertained because no prejudice is caused\\nto the appellants on this count. At this stage we may also take\\nnote of the objection raised on behalf of the caveator-\\ncomplainant that the appellants have not preferred any separate\\nappeal against the judgment of the High Court rendered in Crl.\\nRevision No.443/99 and therefore technically there is no\\nchallenge to that part of the judgment at all. Learned counsel for\\nthe appellants submitted that they have challenged the judgment\\nof the High Court in its entirety, even though the number of the\\nrevision petition is not mentioned in the cause title, therefore,\\nthis objection should not be entertained. We think both the\\ndefects pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants as to\\nnon-issuance of the notice by the High Court as also the\\nargument of the respondent that there being no specific appeal\\nagainst the order of the High Court in Crl. Revision No.443/99\\nare too technical a matter and none of the parties are prejudiced\\nbecause of these technical defaults, therefore, we will consider\\nthe objection of the appellant as to the grant of compensation by\\nthe High Court on its merit. In this regard we have heard Mr. L.\\nK. Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the complainant also.\\nAccording to Mr. Sinha, learned senior counsel, while\\nexercising the power under Section 357 Cr.P.C. if the court\\ndecides to levy a fine then the compensation will have to be\\npaid out of the fine as stipulated under Section 357 (1)(b). In\\nthe instance case he points out that the Sessions Judge had\\nawarded a fine of Rs.5,000/- in regard to the offence under\\nSection 302, therefore, the High Court could have in appeal or\\nrevision, enhanced that fine to a reasonable extent and awarded\\na compensation from out of that amount, according to the\\nlearned counsel, the court could not have awarded\\ncompensation in addition to the fine that is awarded in regard to\\nthe same offence. We are not in agreement with this argumenthttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 6 of 7\\nof the learned counsel. Learned counsel presumes that the High\\nCourt has also confirmed the fine of Rs.5,000/- awarded by the\\nlearned Sessions Judge for offence under Section 302 IPC. A\\nperusal of the operative part of the judgment of the High Court\\nclearly shows that so far as the punishment under Section 302 is\\nconcerned, it has disagreed with the Sessions Court and altered\\nthe sentence to one of life imprisonment from death. It has\\nnowhere stated that it is also awarding a fine or that it was\\nconfirming the fine awarded by the Sessions Court for the\\noffence under Section 302 IPC. In the absence of any such\\nspecific recording in our opinion it should be deemed that the\\nHigh Court has awarded only a sentence of life imprisonment\\nfor an offence under Section 302 IPC. In such cases where the\\ncourt does not award a fine along with a substantive sentence,\\nSection 357(3) comes into play and it is open to the court to\\naward compensation to the victim or his family. In our opinion\\nit is in the exercise of this power under Section 357(3) that the\\nHigh Court has awarded the compensation in question,\\ntherefore it was well within the jurisdiction of the High Court.\\nThe question then is, as contended by the learned counsel for\\nthe appellants, was there sufficient material for awarding this\\nsum of Rs.2 lacs each. Learned counsel submits that this figure\\nis arrived at arbitrarily by the High Court without there being\\nany evidence in this regard and that the High Court has not\\ngiven an opportunity to the appellants to adduce any evidence\\nas to their monetary capability or as to the requirement of\\nvictim’s family. Therefore, the learned counsel pleads that this\\nexorbitant amount could not have been awarded. In support of\\nthis argument learned counsel has relied on Palaniappa Gounder\\nv. The State of Tamil Nadu and Ors. (AIR 1977 SC 1323) and\\nSarwan Singh & Ors. V. The State of Punjab (AIR 1978 SC\\n1525). It is true that in those cases this Court while considering\\nthe compensation awarded by the courts below held that the\\ncompensation in question should commensurate with the\\ncapacity of the accused to pay as also other facts and\\ncircumstances of that case like the gravity of the offence, the\\nneeds of the victim’s family etc. While saying so, we notice\\nfrom these very same judgments cited by the learned counsel\\nthat it is clear that the jurisdiction of the court to grant\\ncompensation is accepted by this Court.\\nIt is true that the High Court in the instant case did not\\nhave sufficient material before it to correctly assess the capacity\\nof the accused to pay the compensation but then keeping the\\nobject of the Section in mind as seen from the reasoning of the\\nHigh Court we think it is a fit case in which the court was\\njustified in invoking Section 357. The question then will be : is\\nthe amount of Rs.2 lakhs per accused too exorbitant a figure ?\\nSince the material on record is scanty, the court will have to\\nassess this monetary figure from material available and also\\ntaking into consideration the facts, judicial notice of which the\\ncourt can take note of.\\nWe have perused the records to find out the reasonable\\namount which would befit the facts of this case as also the\\ncapacity of the appellants to pay. It is on record that the\\nappellants are owning agricultural land though the extent and\\nfertility of the same is not available. It is also seen that they\\nown a tractor and a trolly which we can assume are normally\\nowned by farmers having large extent of land. We also notice\\nthat they own a Maruti car which also indicates that appellant\\nare reasonably affluent. On this basis, we think it is reasonable\\nto conclude that the appellants are capable of paying at least\\nRs.1 lac per head as compensation. Therefore, we modify the\\norder of the High Court by reducing the compensation payable\\nfrom Rs.2 lakhs each to Rs.1 lakh each and direct the appellants\\nto pay the said sum, totalling Rs.2 lakhs, as directed by thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 7 of 7\\nHigh Court.\\nWith this modification the substantive appeal of the\\nappellants in regard to their conviction and sentence is\\ndismissed and their challenge to the grant of compensation is\\naccepted partly and the compensation granted by the High\\nCourt is modified, as stated above.',\n",

AND ANR.\\nRESPONDENT:\\nADDISONS PAINT AND CHEMICALS LTD.\\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 12/09/2003\\nBENCH:\\nRUMA PAL & B.N. SRIKRISHNA\\nJUDGMENT:\\nJUDGMENT\\n2003 Supp(3) SCR 686\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\\nRUMA PAL, J. : The trademarks which are the subject matter of dispute in\\nthese appeals were invented by James Hardie and Company Private Ltd., the\\npredecessor in interest of the first appellant (who will be referred to as\\nHardie). The trademarks consist of the words ’Spartan’ and ’Spartan Velox’\\nand a rear picture of the upper body of a helmeted warrior carrying a\\nshield and spear (which will be referred to hereafter as the Hardie\\ndevice). Registration which was granted in respect of the trademarks in\\nAustralia and New Zealand in 1926 and 1927 continues till today. The\\noriginal trademarks as well as their modified forms, which were also\\nsubsequently registered, have been in use by Hardie or its predecessor in\\ninterest of paints and lacquers and other surface coatings since that date.\\nIt is the case of Hardie that it also wanted to commence business in India\\nand to this end took steps to have the words \"Spartan\" and \"Spartan Velox\"\\nregistered in this country as far back as in 1940. The words were entered\\nin the Register of Trade Marks at Calcutta in Hardie’s name. The\\nregistration was valid for what was then undivided India and other South\\nAsian countries.\\nOn 6th November 1946, a collaboration agreement was entered into between\\nHardie and the respondent (who will be described as Addisons) for a period\\nof 20 years under which addisons was to be Hardie’s \"Chief agent\" in India\\nand other named territories for selling surface coatings supplied by\\nHardie. The agreement also envisaged Addisons being the registered user of\\nthe trademarks during the period of the agreement and also the setting up\\nof a factory by Addisons at Madras to manufacture the surface coatings\\naccording to Hardie’s formulae. Addisons undertook that all formulae and\\ntechnical information which may be supplied to it by Hardie would be\\ntreated as strictly confidential.\\nPursuant to the collaboration agreement, between 1946 to 1949, Hardie’s\\nproducts were marketed in India through Addisons under Hardie’s registered\\ntrademarks and device. By 1948 Addisons had set up its own factory at\\nChennai for manufacturing paints and lacquers and other surface coatings\\nwith the technical know-how supplied by Hardie to Addisons. The products\\nwere then sold by Addisons under the trade mark and device of Hardie for\\nwhich Addisons paid Hardie royalty at agreed rates. The registered-user\\nagreement between Hardie and Addisons was executed on l l th July 1963.\\nApart from the clauses which ensured Hardie’s strict supervision over the\\nquality of the surface coatings manufactured by Addisons, the agreement\\nspecified :\\n\"The said trade marks shall not be used in conjunction with or in close\\njuxtaposition to any other trade mark and shall at all times be sohttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 17\\ndescribed as clearly to indicate that they are the trade marks of the\\nProprietors and that they are being used by the Users only by way of\\npermitted use.\"\\nThis agreement also contained a clause giving Addisons the option to\\nacquire Hardie’s rights in the trade marks for a consideration calculated\\non the basis of the royalties payable for three years as mentioned in the\\ncollaboration agreement. The registered user agreement was initially for a\\nperiod of three years and was operative upto 31st August, 1968. In 1967,\\nHardie had agreed to assign its rights in the trademarks to Addisons for a\\nsum payable in pound sterling. The Reserve Bank of India allegedly refused\\npermission to Addisons to remit the amount. Whatever the reason, it is not\\nin dispute that the consideration was not paid. One of the disputes raised\\nin these appeals relates to the effect of this agreement. To return to the\\nnarration of facts. In anticipation of the assignment the Registered User’s\\nagreement was cancelled on 31st August, 1968. However, since the\\nconsideration was not paid and the assignment did not come through, Hardie\\nrequested Addisons to discontinue the use of Hardie’s trademarks.\\nCorrespondence was exchanged between the parties. Addisons requested for\\npermission to continue to use the trademarks and device Hardie allowed them\\nto do so till December, 1971. During this period. Addisons continued to use\\nHardie’s trademarks and device on the surface coatings produced by it.\\nOn 3rd November 1971, Addisons applied for registration of a device which\\nconsisted of the frontal view of a standing helmeted warrior holding a\\nshield and spear. On l l th November, 1971 Addisons informed Hardie that\\nwith effect from 1st December 1971, it would discontinue the use of\\nHardie’s trade marks and that Addisons had made arrangements to market its\\nproducts in its own brand name. This was followed by several advertisements\\nby Addisons in newspapers to the effect that Addisons’ products would no\\nlonger be sold under the old trade marks but under the brand-name Addisons\\nwith the pictorial representation of the standing warrior.\\nOn 6th December, 1971, Hardie applied for registration of the composite\\nmarks of \"Spartan\" and Hardie’s device in respect of surface coatings.\\nHowever, the application was withdrawn on 26th April, 1974.\\nIn November 1976, Addisons obtained registration of the standing warrior\\ndevice. In the same year it filed three applications before the Registrar\\nof Trade Marks at Mumbai for registration of Hardie’s trademarks. The\\napplications were rejected on the grounds of identity and deceptive\\nsimilarity with Hardie’s registered trademarks.\\nDuring this period, that is between 1972 to 1977, negotiations took place\\nbetween Hardie and Hansa, the second appellant before us, for appointing\\nHansa, the registered user of Hardie’s trademarks in India. The agreement\\nwas ultimately executed on 31st March, 1977.\\nAbout two months later, on 30th May, 1977 Addisons applied in Calcutta for\\nrectification of the Register of Trademarks by deleting Hardie’s trademarks\\nunder Section 46(1) of the Act.\\nOn 18th November, 1977, Addisons filed two applications for registration of\\nHardie’s device. Addisons also filed three additional applications for\\nregistration in class (2) of the Hardie’s device and the word ’Spartan’ in\\nclass (2) for the words of ’Spartan Velox’ and for class (3) for Hardie’s\\ndevice with the word ’Spartan’.\\nDuring the pendency of these applications for rectification and\\nregistration, Hardie and Hansa filed two suits (Suit Nos. 835 and 836 of\\n1978) in the Calcutta High Court in November, 1978, for inter alia an\\ninjunction restraining Addisons from dealing in paints and other surface\\ncoatings under Hardie’s trademarks or device. Interlocutory applications\\nwere filed by Hardie and Hansa in these suits which were disposed of by a\\nconsent order on 22nd February, 1979. The consent order in effect allowedhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 17\\nHardie and Hansa to continue to use the registered trademarks and device of\\nHardie, and allowed Addisons to use its registered trademarks and device of\\nthe standing warrior until the disposal of the suits. The suits are still\\npending. The scope and effect of this consent order is also one of the\\nissues to be determined in these appeals.\\nDecember 1979 saw Addisons file a civil suit in the Madras High Court (C.S.\\nNo. 204 of 1978) against Hansa seeking a permanent injunction restraining\\nHansa from selling paints in containers which were identical to or\\ndeceptively similar with Hardie’s trademarks or device which Addisons\\nclaimed had been used by it since 1963. An application was filed by\\nAddisons in the suit pending before the High Court in Madras in 1979,\\nalleging that Hardie and Hansa had committed contempt by using Hardie’s\\ndevice. This was disposed of eventually by the Madras High Court with the\\ndirection that status quo was to be continued in terms of the consent Order\\ndated 22nd February, 1979 in the Calcutta High Court proceedings. The suit\\nis pending.\\nIn the same month, Hardie filed an application in the Calcutta suit for\\nstay of the rectification proceedings which were then pending before the\\nJoint Registrar of Trade Marks at Calcutta. The application was dismissed\\nby the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court and the appeal\\ntherefrom dismissed by the Division Bench. The application for\\nrectification filed by Addisons was allowed by the Joint Registrar of Trade\\nMarks at Calcutta by his order dated 12th September, 1985 as a result of\\nwhich Hardie’s trademarks were expunged from the Register of Trade Marks.\\nBoth Hardie and Hansa appealed against this order to the Calcutta High\\nCourt before a learned Single Judge. The appeal was dismissed on 6th July,\\n1990. On a further appeal the Division Bench confirmed the learned Single\\nJudge’s order on 22nd August, 1997. The decision of the Division Bench is\\nthe subject matter of S.L.P. No. 206 of 1998.\\nPending the rectification proceedings in Calcutta, an application was filed\\nby Hansa for stay of the registration proceedings relating to ’Spartan’ and\\n’Spartan Velox’. The application was rejected by the Assistant Registrar,\\nMadras on 19th June 1989. On the, same day Addisons’ application for\\nregistration of Hardie’s device was allowed. Although five appeals were\\npreferred in respect of each of the separate applications before the Madras\\nHigh Court the learned Single Judge dismissed all the five appeals by a\\ncommon judgment.\\nThe matter came up before the Division Bench. There was a difference of\\nopinion. The Third Judge agreed with the view that the appeals should be\\ndismissed. The majority decision is the subject matter of challenge in C.A.\\nNos. 5307-5311 of 1993.\\nTill the decision of the Madras High Court Hansa’s and Hardie’s opposition\\nto Addisons’ applications for registration of ’Spartan’ and’ Spartan Velox’\\nwere still pending. On 2nd June, 1992, the applications were allowed by the\\nRegistrar at Madras. This has been challenged in C.A. Nos. 5312 & 12A - E\\nof 1993.\\nWhen leave was granted on the special leave petition filed by Hansa and\\nHardie on 8th October, 1993 impugning the order of the Madras High Court,\\nthis Court had directed the continuation of the status quo. That status quo\\nis still operative. This in brief is the background of the appeals. \\\\007\\nWe propose to deal with the issue of rectification (which is the subject\\nmatter of SLP 206 of 1988) first and then the question of registration of\\nHardie’s device and trademarks separately (which are the subject matter of\\nC.A. No. 5307-11/1993 and C.A. No. 5312 and 12A-E of 1993 respectively.\\nS.L.P. (C) No. 206 of 1998 Rectification of the Trademarks Register Leave\\ngranted.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 17\\nIn the rectification applications filed on 27th May, 1977 by Addisons, it\\nwas stated that Addisons had \"invented and adopted\" the trademark of\\nAddison’s and the device of warrior in 1971 to distinguish the goods\\nmanufactured by it from others. The collaboration agreement was referred to\\nin passing but the details were not given, as, according to Addison’s\\nstatement, they were not necessary for the determination of the application\\nfor rectification.\\nThe application went on to say that from 1971 onwards Addisons \"felt the\\nnecessity of having a second trade mark of distinguishing certain goods\\nmanufactured and sold by it. After giving the matter serious thought, it\\ndecided to use a trade mark containing a device of a warrior and the legend\\nSpartan\". The application also says that Addisons came to know of the\\nregistration of the trademarks in Hardie’s name only after Addisons’\\napplication for registration of the trademarks was rejected by the\\nRegistrar of Trade Marks at Bombay. It was also said that \"extensive market\\nresearch\" had been done and it was discovered that the trademarks had not\\nbeen used in India for over five years continuously. Addisons claimed that\\nthe trade marks registered in Hardie’s name were identical of deceptively\\nsimilar with the trademarks sought to be registered by Addisons giving it\\nthe locus to seek rectification of the Trademarks Register by expunging\\nHardie’s trademarks therefrom.\\nAddisons’ applications for the removal of the trademarks which were\\nregistered in Hardie’s name since 1946 were only under Section 46(1) of the\\nAct.\\nThe relevant extracts of Section 46 of the Act read as follows : \"Removal\\nfrom register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use. - (1)\\nSubject to the povisions of Section 47, a registered trade mark may be\\ntaken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which\\nit is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High\\nCourt or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground ...\\n(b) that up to a date one month before the date of application, a\\ncontinuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the\\ntrade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use\\nthereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time\\nbeing :\\n(3) An application shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose\\nof clause (b) of sub-section (1)..............(on any non-use of\\na trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in\\nthe trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark\\nin relation to the goods to which the applicaton relates.\"\\nThus before the High Court or the Registrar direct the removal of the\\nregistered trademarks they must be satisfied in respect of the following :\\n(1) That the application is by a ’person aggrieved’;\\n(2) That the trade mark has not been used by the proprietor for\\ncontinuous period of at least five years and one month prior to the date of\\nthe application;\\n(3) There were no special circumstances which affected the use of the\\ntrade mark during this period by the proprietor.\\nThe onus to establish the first two conditions obviously lies with the\\napplicant, whereas the burden of proving the existence of special\\ncircumstances is on the proprietor of the trade marks. These conditions are\\nnot to be cumulatively proved but established seriatim. There is no\\nquestion of the third condition being established unless the second one hashttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 17\\nalready been proved and there is no question of the second one even being\\nconsidered unless the High Court or the Registrar is satisfied as to the\\nlocus standi of the applicant.\\n(a) Person aggrieved - On this issue the Joint Registrar held that Addisons\\nwas a \"person aggrieved\". The principal ground of doing so was the fact\\nthat Addisons carried on the same trade and its applications for\\nregistration had been rejected on the ground of the existence of Hardies\\nmarks.\\nThe learned Single Judge upheld the decision of the Registrar on this issue\\nbecause Addisons was in the same trade as Hardie \"and may be able to use\\nthe said mark in relation to own goods but for the existence of the\\nregistered marks in the name of Hardie\". The Division Bench affirmed this\\nview.\\nThe phrase \"person aggrieved\" is a common enough statutory precondition for\\na valid complaint or appeal. The phrase has been variously construed\\ndepending on the context in which it occurs. Three sections viz. Section\\n46, 56 and 69 of the Act contain the phrase. Section 46 deals with the\\nremoval of a registered trademark from the register on the ground of non-\\nuse. This section presupposes that the registration which was validly made\\nis liable to be taken off by subsequent non-user. Section 56 on the other\\nhand deals with situations where the initial registration should not have\\nbeen or was incorrectly made. The situations covered by this section\\ninclude :- (a) the contravention or failure to observe a condition for\\nregistration; (b) the absence of an entry; (c) an entry made without\\nsufficient cause; (d) a wrong entry; and (e) any error or defect in the\\nentry. Such type of actions are commenced for the \"purity of the register\"\\nwhich it is in public interest to maintain. Applications under Sections 46\\nand 56 may be made to the Registrar who is competent to grant the relief.\\n\"Person’s aggrieved\" may also apply for cancellation or varying an entry in\\nthe register relating to a certification trademark to the Central\\nGovernment in certain circumstances. Since we are not concerned with a\\ncertification trademark, the process for registration of which is entirely\\ndifferent, we may exclude the interpretation of the phrase \"person\\naggrieved\" occurring in section 69 from consideration for the purposes of\\nthis judgment.\\nIn our opinion the phrase \"person aggrieved\" for the purposes of removal on\\nthe ground of non-use under section 46 has a different connotation from the\\nphrase used in section 56 for cancelling or expunging or varying an entry\\nwrongly made or remaining in the Register.\\nIn the latter case the locus standi would be ascertained liberally, since\\nit would not only be against the interest of other persons carrying on the\\nsame trade but also in the interest of the public to have such wrongful\\nentry removed. It was in this sense that the House of Lords defined \"person\\naggrieved\" in the matter of Powell’s Trade Mark, (1894) 11 RFC 4 :\\n\"... although they were no doubt inserted to prevent officious interference\\nby those who had no interest at all in the Register being correct, and to\\nexclude a mere common informer, it is undoubtedly of public interest that\\nthey should not be unduly limited, inasmuch as it is a public mischief that\\nthere should remain upon the Register a Mark which ought not to be there,\\nand by which many persons may be affected, who, nevertheless, would not be\\nwilling to enter upon the risk and expense of litigation.\\nWherever it can be shown, as here, that the Applicant is in the same trade\\nas the person who has registered the Trade mark, and wherever the Trade\\nMark, if remaining on the Register, would, or might, limit the legal rights\\nof the Applicant, so that by reason, of the existence of the entry on the\\nRegister he could not lawfully do that which, but for the existence of the\\nmark upon the Register, he could lawfully do, it appears to me he has a\\nlocus standi to be heard as a person aggrieved.\"http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 6 of 17\\n(Emphasis added)\\nBut if the ground for rectification is merely based on non-user i.e. under\\nSection 46 of the Act, that is not really on account of any public mischief\\nby way of an incorrect entry. The non-user does not by itself render the\\nentry incorrect but it gives a right to a person whose interest is affected\\nto apply for its removal. An applicant must therefore show that \"in some\\npossible way he may be damaged or injured if the Trade Mark is allowed to\\nstand; and by \"possible\" I mean possible in a practical sense, and not\\nmerely in a fantastic view..... All cases of this kind, where the orginal\\nregistration is not illegal or improper, ought to be considered as\\nquestions of common sense, to a certain extent, at any rate; and I think\\nthe Applicants ought to show something approaching a sufficient or proper\\nreason for applying to have the Trade Mark expunged. It certainly is not\\nsufficient reason that they are at loggerheads with the Respondents or\\ndesire in someway to injure them.’\"\\nAddisons’ application was one under Section 46 and the test to determine\\nwhether the applicant was a ’person aggrieved’ within the meaning of that\\nsection should have been the one laid down by Romer, J. in Wright’s case\\nand not the one propounded by the house of Lords in the matter of Powell’s\\nTrade Mark (supra). The High Court and the Joint Registrar fell into error\\nin not drawing this distinction. However, it is not necessary to dilate on\\nthis aspect of the matter as the appellant has really argued on the second\\nand third aspects of section 46 viz. the alleged non-use of the trade marks\\nby Hardie and special circumstances.\\n(b) Non-use of the trademarks : Under Section 46 (l)(b) of the Act an\\napplication for removal of a registered trademark will be allowed only if a\\ncontinuous period of five years or longer has elapsed upto the date of one\\nmonth prior to the date of the application during which there was no bona\\nfide use by the proprietor of the trademark sought to be removed. Since\\nAddisons’ applications for rectification were filed on 30th May, 1977, the\\nrelevant period for consideration of the question of non-use is from 30th\\nApril, 1972 to 30th April, 1977.\\nHardie has contended that there was no non-use of the registered trademarks\\nduring that period. It is submitted that in any event it is only such non-\\nuse as evinced an intention to abandon the trademarks which would enable an\\napplicant to apply for removal of the trade-marks. It is said that Addisons\\nhad failed to plead or establish this.\\nThe word ’use’ according to the respondent means ’actually putting the mark\\nin the business and utilizing the same for selling the goods’. It is said\\nthat there had been no use of the trade mark by Hardie and no efforts taken\\nto manufacture goods using the trade mark since 1971 and, therefore, it\\nmust be taken that Hardie had abandoned the trade mark. It is also urged in\\nthe written submissions that the ’plea of user’ had not been argued either\\nbefore the Single Judge or the Division Bench of the High Court.\\nThe last submission does not appear to be correct. The Division\\n1. Wright, Crossley, Tm : 1898 (15) RPC 131 at p. 133 per Romer J affirmed\\non appeal (1898) 15 RPC 377.\\nBench had addressed itself to the question and as far as the intent to use\\nthe existing trademark was concerned it was said that there was\\n\".....an onerous duty cast onto the registered proprietor not only to show\\nthat there is no intentional abandonment or intent to use the trade mark,\\nin relation to the goods, but there must exist a definite intent to use the\\nmark and a continuation of the same throughout the entire period as\\nenvisaged in the statute but all his efforts were rendered fruitless by\\nreason of the statutory ban on imports. Th affidavit of Buttress, however,http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 7 of 17\\nnegates such a situa-tion and as such the issue under Section 46(3) being\\nanswered in favour of the appellant does not and cannot arise\".\\nIn any event the contention has been expressly raised in the special leave\\npetition and argued extensively by counsel for the appellants. Submissions\\nhave been equally extensively made both in the counter affidavit and by\\nAddison’s counsel in the course of arguments before us. In the circumstance\\nwe do not think that it would at all be proper not to decide the issue.\\nThe Joint Registrar construed the word \"use\" in section 46(1 )(b) to mean\\nuse of the trademark on the goods in respect of which the trade mark is\\nregistered. He relied upon letter written by Hansa’s lawyers to Addisons\\ndated 25th December 1977 in which it was stated that Hansa had not\\nmanufactured or sold any goods under the trademarks, to hold - first, that\\nneither Hansa nor Hardie had sold any goods during the relevant period and,\\nsecond, that therefore there was no use of the registered trademarks. Both\\nthe Single Judge and the Division Bench appear to have proceeded on the\\nsame basis.\\nThe question therefore is - is the word \"use\" in Section 46(1) so limited?\\nThe phrase used in Section 46 is \"bona fide use thereof in relation to\\nthose goods\". The phrase has been defined in Section 2(2)(b) of the Act as\\n:\\n\"to the use of a mark in relation to goods shall be construed as a\\nreference to the use of the mark upon, or in any physical or in any other\\nrelation -whatsoever, to such goods\".\\nThis shows that the use may be other than physical. It may be in any other\\nrelation to the goods. Given this statutory meaning, we see no reason to\\nlimit the user to use on the goods or to sale of goods bearing the\\ntrademark.\\nIn Hermes Trade Mark 1872 RPC 425, the registered proprietor had inserted\\nadvertisements in which the trademark appeared in relation to the watches\\nit manufactured in the annual trade publication. It was also in evidence\\nthat the registered proprietor placed an order for parts of the watches\\nduring the period of alleged non-use although the actual sale of the\\nwatches took place subsequently. In this factual background, the words,\\n’other relation’ in an identical statutory provision in the United Kingdom\\nwere construed to mean \"something other than actually being upon the goods\\nor in physical relation to them - that would cover the use of the mark,\\n................, for example, in advertisements, in invoices, in orders\\nand so on\". It was also said, the phrase ’in the course of trade’ must be\\nwide enough to embrace the steps necessary for the production of the goods\\nas well as the actual placing of them on the market. It was held that even\\nthough there was no use of the mark upon or in physical relation to the\\n\"goods, but it was used in \"other relation\", i.e. to say in non physical\\nuse.\\n.A more recent example of the law in England of such \"non-physical use\" is\\nto be found in Bon Matin Trade Mark 1989 RPC 536. The trade mark was\\nregistered in the United Kingdom in 1979 in respect of a-range of\\ncosmetics. The registered proprietor was a resident of France and\\nmanufactured and sold the goods there. In 1984, an application was made to\\nexpunge the registration on the ground that there had been no bona fide use\\nof the mark in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of five years.\\nThe only use of the mark prior to the date of the application was by issue\\nof price lists and promotional literature on two occasions. A distributor\\nwas appointed by the proprietor in the United Kingdom subsequent to the\\napplication for rectification and the first sale of the goods took place 3\\nyears after that. The Court held that the intention of the registered\\nproprietor to seek to establish a market not on any temporary basis but on\\nthe basis of continuous sales had been proved. As they had been struggling\\nto market the goods in the United Kingdom and ultimately were successful inhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 8 of 17\\nfinding a distributor, it was held that this was sufficient use of the mark\\nby the proprietor for the purpose of defeating the application for its\\nremoval. In Section 2(2)(b) of the Act, we have the additional words \"any\"\\nand \"whatsoever\" qualifying the words ’other relation’ giving the words a\\nmuch wider meaning. Reading this definition into Section 46(1). It is clear\\nthat the word ’use’ in Section 46(1) may encompass actions other than\\nactual sale.\\nThe error committed by the three fora below starting with the Joint\\nRegistrar was to read the intention to abandon as being limited to the\\nspecial circumstances of the trade as if there could be no intention to\\nabandon unless there were such special circumstances. Sub-section 3 to\\nSection 46 says that the applicant can rely only on the non-use unless it\\nis shown by the registered owner to be due to special circumstances in the\\ntrade and not to any intention either to abandon or not to use the trade\\nmark. There is a distinction between the intention to abandon which is part\\nof the ’no bona fide use in relation to those goods’ in subsection (1) of\\nSection 46 which gives a cause for removal of the trademark and the\\nintention to use under sub-Section (3) of Section 46 provides a special\\ndefence to the registered proprietor and is ’inferred from the existence of\\nspecial circumstances.\\nThat the proprietor’s intention to abandon the trademarks is a necessary\\ncomponent of their non user justifying their removal, was recognized as\\nearly as 1884 by Chitty, J. in the case of Mouson & Co. v. Boehm, 26 Ch.D.\\n398. In that case, the owner of the trade mark, Boehm had adopted a trade\\nmark for a particular kind of soap. The soap was manufactured and sent to\\nthe United Kingdom in large qualities for about two years. In the next six\\nyears, the \"manufacture and sale of soap thus marked fell off until it\\npractically ceased and the existence of the particular mark was forgotten\"\\nby Boehm. The same mark was registered in the U.K. in respect of soaps by\\nMouson & Co. Boehm sued Mouson & Co. inter-alia to restrain the\\ninfringement of his trade mark and for removal of the trade mark from the\\nRegister. Mouson’s defence was that Boehm had abandoned the trade marks. In\\nnegativing this, Chitty, J. held :\\n\"Mr. Boehm retained that mark, he did not break up the moulds according to\\nthe practice which he stated he adopted when he intend to give up any\\nparticular mark. He did not even erase the trade-mark from his books, and\\nthere were persons in the market who got the goods from him who were\\nendeavouring to effect sales, and he by sending over those price lists to\\nthe number of 1200 during the years spoken to was himself endeavouring to\\neffect sales........\\nHere it appears to me there was no absolute non-user for any sufficient\\ntime, taken in connection with all the circumstances, to show an intention\\nto abandon..............\\nThe trade-mark was not of very great value to him (and on that I will make\\nan observation presently), still I think it was his trade-mark before, and\\nhe has not lost it by adandonment.\"\\nThe same view appears to have prevailed in the United States. This was\\nexpressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1911 in Baglin v.\\nCusenier Co., 211 US 580, 596-598 :\\n\"But the loss of the right of property in trademarks upon the ground of\\nabandonment is not to be viewed as a penalty either for nonuser or for the\\ncreation and use of new devices. There must be found an intent to abandon,\\nor the *property is not lost; and while, of course, as in other cases,\\nintent may be inferred when the facts are shown, yet the facts must be\\nadequate to support the finding\".\\nThe law has since been changed so that at present as ’intent not to resume’\\nuse of the mark is to be proved2. Nevertheless, \"since abandonment resultshttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 9 of 17\\nin a forfeiture of rights, the courts are reluctant to find an\\nabandonment\". Under the majority rule, evidence of abandonment must be\\nclear and convincing. The New York Court of Appeals stated that\\n\"Abandonment being in the nature of a forfeiture, must be strictly proved.\"\\nAs far as this country is concerned, Section 46(3) of the Act statutorily\\nprescribes the intention to abandon as an essential component of non-use\\nfor the purposes of Section 46(1). In American Home Products Corpora-tion\\nv. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd and Anr., [1981] 1 SCC 465, this Court\\n2. See McCarthy in Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3rd Edn.) Vol. 2 para\\n17.03 was called upon to decide whether there was any bona fide use of the\\ntrade mark in relation to goods by the proprietor or for the purposes of\\nSection 46(1)(a) of the Act. Under Section 46(1)(a), the trademarks which\\nwere registered without any bona fide intention to use them in relation to\\nthe goods and which have in fact not been used by the proprietor from the\\ndate of such registration upto to the date of the application of\\nregistration, are liable to be taken off the register. The Court held that\\nboth the intention of the proprietor not to use the trade mark at the time\\nof registration and also the actual non-use of the trade mark subsequent\\nthereto had to be proved. The evidence in that case was that prior to\\nregistration, the proprietor had entered into a collaboration agreement\\nwith an Indian company to manufacture and, market its products. Subsequent\\nto the registration, the Indian company obtained a licence for the purpose\\nof imposing a machine to manufacture proprietor’s goods, obtained samples\\nfrom the proprietor and took other steps to manufacture the goods, but no\\nproducts were in fact put on the market. After the application for\\nrectification was filed, a registered user agreement was entered into\\nbetween the proprietor and the Indian company. It was not in dispute that\\nthe goods had not been sold during the alleged period of non-use.\\nDismissing the application for rectification, this Court held :\\n\"A person who intends to manufacture goods on has made preparations for the\\nmanufacture of goods but the manufacture has not commenced and, therefore,\\ngoods have not been marketed is nonetheless entitled to get the trade mark\\nwhich he proposes to use in relation to those goods registered. In the\\npresent day world of commerce and industry, a manufacturing industry can\\nneither be commenced nor established overnight. There are innumerable\\npreparatory steps required to be taken and formalities to be complied with\\nbefore the manufacture of goods can start and the manufactured goods\\nmarketed. The process must of necessity take time. If the position were\\nthat the mere non-user of a trade mark for the period mentioned in clause\\n(a) of Section 46(1) would make a trade mark liable to be taken off the\\nRegister, it would result in great hardship and cause a large number of\\ntrade marks to be removed from the Register, because the moment one month\\nhas elapsed after the registration of a trade mark has been ordered, a\\ntrade rival can make an application on the ground set out in clause (a) of\\nSection 46(1) claiming that there has been no bona fide use of the trade\\nmark up to a date one month before the date of his application.\"\\nAlthough the decision was given in the context of Section 46(1 )(a)\\nnonetheless it would show that an intention to use does not necessarily\\nmean that the proprietor must show the marketing of the goods under the\\ntrademark. This decision is also an authority for the proposition that the\\nintention to use the trade marks required of the proprietor would include\\nthe intention to permit the user of the trade mark by the registered user.\\nIndeed that would be the inevitable and logical result of reading section\\n46(1) with Section 48(2) of the Act.\\n\"The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the\\nproprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other\\nthan the proprietor, for the purposes of Section 46 or for any other\\npurpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law\".\\n[See also \"Astronaut\" Trade Mark 1972 RPC 655]http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 10 of 17\\nIt is a moot point whether the onus to prove this aspect of non user is on\\nthe applicant or on the registered user. Irrespective of the onus of proof,\\nthe question is, was there any evidence of such intention on Hardies’ part\\neither not to use the trademark itself or through the registered user\\nduring the relevant period? The evidence on record certainly does not\\nsupport any such intention. The correspondence exchanged between Hardie and\\nHansa demonstrates that at least from 6th October, 1971 i.e. prior to the\\nperiod in question, Hansa and Hardie were negotiating a registered user\\nagreement under which Hansa, in effect, would do what Addisons had done\\nunder its agreement with Hardie. The initial hurdle to the negotiations was\\nthe fact that the registered user agreement between Hardie and Addisons\\nrequired Hardie to give one month’s notice to Addisons to cease use of\\nHardie’s trademarks. The notice period in this case expired only on 1st\\nDecember, 1971. After Addisons’ public declaration of its intention not to\\nuse Hardie’s trademarks, negotiations went ahead between the officers of\\nHardie and Hansa. The letters record several meetings and also show that a\\ndraft registered user agreement in respect of trademarks was prepared by\\n6th February, 1973. The second hurdle as appearing from the correspondence\\ndisclosed, was a lack of communication between Hardies’ Attorneys, Remfry &\\nSons at Calcutta, and Hansa. Ultimately by a letter dated 15th October,\\n1973 to Hansa the Attorneys said that the registered user agreement had\\nbeen approved by Hardie. In terms of clause 4 of the approved draft\\nagreement, Hansa was required to make payments of royalty in Australian\\ndollars to Hardie for the period of the agreement, the first of such\\npayments being made within \"one month of the grant of approval of this\\nagreement by the Government of India and other authority/authorities whose\\napproval may be required\". This approval was the third hurdle to the\\nnegotiations. Hansa and Hardie applied to the Reserve Bank of India but in\\n1976 the Reserve Bank of India refused to approve the payment of the\\nroyalty in foreign exchange under Section 28 of the Foreign Exchange\\n(Regulation) Act, 1973. On 26th November, 1976, Remfry & Sons advised\\nHardie that getting the Reserve Bank to grant the required permission in\\nthe \"atmosphere\" prevailing would be futile. As such it recommended that\\nthe payment of royalty clause should be scrapped and the agreement revised\\nto state that in consideration of the rights granted, Hansa would maintain\\na watch on and report cases of infringement and/or passing off of the\\ntrademarks and would bear the costs of any legal action that may have to be\\nresorted to in such cases. It was in these circumstances that, the original\\ndraft was revised, and on 31st March, 1977 i.e. within the period in\\nquestion, the registered user agreement was ultimately executed between\\nHardie and Hansa.\\nThis evidence, which was not disbelieved by any of the fora below, negates\\nHardies’ alleged intention to abandon the use of the trademarks. There was\\nas such no \"absolute non-user\" of the trademarks by Hardie during the\\nperiod of five years and one month prior of the applications for\\nrectification. This is suffcient for this Court to allow the appeal.\\n(c) Special Circumstances : Apart from the fact that it had no intention\\nnot to use the trademarks during the statutory period Hardie also claimed\\nthat it was unable to use its trademarks directly in India because of\\nspecial circumstances within the meaning of sub section 3 of Section 46. It\\nrelied upon the Import Trade Control Policy for the period April 1972 to\\nMarch 1974 and April 1974 to March 1975 to contend that the import of\\npaints and varnishes was prohibited, a prohibition which continued much\\nbeyond the date of the making of the applications by Addisons for removal\\nof Hardie’s trademarks. In fact, because of the declared import trade\\ncontrol policy, even Hansa’s application for registration as a registered\\nuser in India of the trademarks was refused by the Assistant Registrar of\\nTrademarks on the ground that it was against the policy of the Government\\nto allow registration of foreign trademarks for use in India.\\nThe Joint Registrar rejected Hardie’s submission that there were any\\nspecial circumstances within the meaning of sub-Section (3) of Section 46http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 11 of 17\\nwhich would protect Hardie’s trademarks from removal on the ground of non-\\nuser. According to him.\\n\"The non-use was due to considerations of the Registered Proprietors own\\nbusiness interests and is not attributable to circumstances affecting the\\ntrade in general\".\\nThe learned Single Judge affirmed the finding of the Registrar and held\\nthat there was no total ban on import of paints and lacquers but the reason\\nfor non-use of the trademarks by Hardie were \"economic, commer-cial and\\nother factors which were applicable only to the appellants\". The Division\\nBench while noting the submissions on the Import Trade Policy did not give\\nany finding on whether there was a restriction on the import of paints and\\nlacquers for domestic use during the relevant period but rested its\\napproval of the view taken by the Registrar and the learned Single Judge on\\na paragraph in an affidavit affirmed by Andrew Buttress on behalf of Hardie\\nbefore the Registrar. The paragraph reads :\\n\"Assuming but not admitting that there was no import restriction at the\\nrelevant time, my company could not have the trade mark used in India by a\\nregistered user immediately after the applicants ceased using the marks in\\n1971 but carried on negotiations with Hansa Paints & Chemicals in 1972, but\\nas is quite natural in such cases, it took some time to finalise such\\nagreement. Further, having regard to the state of the market and the demand\\nfor the goods in question, and also my company’s commitments in other\\ncountries, it was not possible nor was it considered economical to put more\\ngoods on the market immediately\".\\nConstruing this paragraph the Division Bench held that economic viability\\nor existing market conditions was outside the concept of \"special\\ncircumstances\", and since the statute only provided for the defence of\\nspecial circumstances, \"any other defence apart from the existence of\\nspecial circumstances does not and cannot rise.\"\\nThe observation of the Division Bench that apart from special\\ncircumstances, there was no other defence available to a proprietor in\\nproceedings to remove his trademark from the register, is as we have\\nalready indicated, incorrect. The proprietor can show, as Hardie, has done\\nin this case, that there was no intention to abandon the trademarks. If,\\nthat is established it is a complete defence to the action. The second\\nerroneous finding of the Division Bench was that economic viability or\\nexisting market condition was outside the concept of special circumstances.\\nThe finding does not follow from the Section and is against the weight of\\nauthority.\\nSpecial circumstances have been defined in Aktiebolaget Manus v. R.J. Full-\\nwood and Bland, Ltd., (1949) 66 RPC 71 as \"some external forces as distinct\\nfrom voluntary acts of any individual\"..........where the impact of local\\ncondition makes impractical the ordinary usage of international trade\". In\\nthat case it was held phohibitive tariffs which were practically effective\\nto keep out of England altogether machines manufactured abroad which had,\\ntill the tariffs had been imposed, been imported to the country amounted to\\nspecial circumstances. The facts in Manus’ case are similar to the facts\\nwhich we have to consider. In dispute were trademarks as applied to milking\\nmachines. The proprietor of the marks was a Swedish company. The machines\\nhad been imported into Britain through the defendant as its agent. When the\\nimport of the milking machines was stopped by the registered proprietors,\\nthe agent claimed the trademarks as its own and started manufacturing and\\nselling milking machines bearing the same trademarks. The proprietor\\nbrought an action for infringement of its trademarks. The question before\\nthe Court was whether the actions of the defendant subsequent to the\\ntapering off of the import of the Swedish Company’s machines, were\\neffective to appropriate to themselves what had been before the Swedish\\nCompany’s property or as having been effective to destroy the distinctive\\ncharacter of the name as indicating the Swedish Company’s business so as tohttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 12 of 17\\nput an end to its right to the name in England. The question was answered\\nin the negative and it was held that the non-user was justified because of\\nthe special circumstances prevailing at the relevant period.\\nIn Mouson & Co. v. Boehm (supra), it was said that ’A’ man who has a trade\\nmark may properly have regard to the state of the market and the demand for\\nthe goods; it would be absurd to suppose he lost his trade mark by not\\nputting more goods in the market when it was glutted.\"\\nMore recently, Justice Ungoed Thomas in BALI Trade Mark (Rectification\\nCh.D.) 1966 RPC 387 said :\\n\"It is quite clear, however, that the proprietors, the Bali Company, could\\nnot have used the token import scheme, unless an interested firm in this\\ncountry made the appropriate application and no such application was made.\\nIt was thus not possible for the company to import under the token scheme,\\nand that was not their fault. Further, what has to be considered is not\\nmerely the existence of an absolute prohibition to import, as might be\\nthought from one passage in the Assistant Comptroller’s decision, or a\\ncomplete impossibility of importing, but in the words of Evershed, L.J\\n(supra) the existence of conditions \"making impracticable the ordinary\\nusages of international trade.\" \"A trade mark is a commercial asset\\nintended to be used commercially by business men, and it seems to me that\\n\"special circumstances\" have to be understood and applied in a business\\nsense. In my view, this token import scheme modification to the earlier\\ngeneral prohibition did not convert what was before impossible into what\\nwas, in a business sense, practicable, even if a firm in this country had\\nmade the necessary application under that scheme. The non-use of the trade\\nmark by the Bali Company, even during the token import scheme, is thus in\\nmy view, shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade.\"\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\nThe Court of Appeal reversed this decision on another issue. The House of\\nLords in turn reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and reaffirmed\\nthe decision of Justice Ungoed Thomas in Berlei (U.K.) Ltd. v. Bali\\nBrassiere Co. Inc., (1969) 2 All ER 812. This view has been accepted as\\ngood law in this country. [See A.J. Vulcan v. V.S. Palanichamy, AIR (1969)\\nCal. 43 and Express Bottlers Services Pvt. Ltd. v. Pepsi Inc. & Ors.,\\n(1989) PTC 14.] The law therefore is that even an economical\\nimpracticability would amount to special circumstances.\\nThe indisputable evidence shows and the admitted position is that from 1946\\nto 1971 Addisons was using the trademark first as the chief agent of Hardie\\nunder the collaborative agreement, and then under the registered users\\nagreement. Apart from the express clauses in the two agreement by which\\nHardie retained its rights over the trademarks, under Sections 48(2) read\\nwith S.2(m) :\\n\"The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the\\nproprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other\\nthan the proprietor, for the purposes of Section 46 or for any other\\npurpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law\".\\nAddisons therefore never ’used’ the trade marks on its own account. For the\\npurposes of Section 46, its use of the trademarks prior to 1971 was\\nagreement and by the fiction created under Section 48(2), Hardie’s use.\\n(See : Cycle Corporation of India, Ltd. v. T.I. Raleigh Industries Pvt.\\nLtd., [1996] 9 SCC 430, 436.) Addisons had not even attempted to use the\\ntrademarks at any time subsequent to 1971 i.e. after it had publicly\\ndisassociated itself from the marks. In fact Addisons admitted that it did\\nnot use the trademarks from 1963 to 1977 in the written statements filed in\\nthe suits for infringement pending in Calcutta.\\nWe cannot ignore the fundamental fact that what Hardie and Addisons hadhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 13 of 17\\nbeen engaged in together was the introduction and sale in the Indian market\\nof the paints and lacquers prepared according to Hardie’s preparation and\\nunder Hardie’s trademark. In this background, where by legal fiction\\natleast Hardie had used the trademarks from 1946 to 1961, it would be a\\nlegally insupportable proposition if we were to hold that the names Spartan\\nand Spartan Velox were associated with Addisons and not with Hardie.\\nTherefore, when the applications for rectification were made, there was\\nnothing in law to associate Addisons with the trademarks in question. This\\nbackground coupled with Hardie’s attempts to appoint Hansa as the\\nregistered user of the trademark in India must be kept in sight while\\nconsidering the plausibility of the defence of special circumstances under\\nthe provisions of Section 46(3) of the Act.\\nHardie had brought on record the Import Trade Control Policies for the\\nrelevant years. We have considered the same and it is quite clear that\\npaints, distempers, varnishes and lacquers could be imported only for use\\nby actual users i.e. by manufacturers or producers of the paints etc. in\\nIndia. Hardie had no such factory. There was in the circumstances no\\nquestion of Hardie importing any paints and lacquers manufactured by it\\noutside India into the country. There was a second restriction under the\\nImport Control Policies even on actual users who imported paint for their\\nown use. They had to use the imported goods for producing goods as\\nspecified only for export. The intention of the policy clearly was to keep\\nthe domestic market for the domestic producers of paints and lacquers.\\nConcerns like Hardie could not, without making an enormous investment by\\nsetting up a factory, import the goods.\\nIn the circumstance, for Buttress to have said that it was not economically\\npossible for Hardie to itself put its manufactured goods in the market\\nimmediately, cannot be taken as being a circumstance which was peculiar to\\nHardie alone. It was a circumstance which was generally applicable to all\\nforeign manufacturers of paints and lacquers. Therefore, the conclusion of\\nthe Joint Registrar and the High Court that there were no special\\ncircumstances in the trade which justified the alleged non-user for the\\nperiod in question was wrong. In view of our findings, it is not necessary\\nto go into the further question of the discretionary power of the Registrar\\nto refuse rectification even if the application is otherwise maintainable.\\nFor all these reasons, we set aside the decisions impugned and allow the\\nappeal with costs.\\nCivil Appeal No. 5307-5311 of 1993\\nThese arise out of five appeals of which three relate to the refusal to\\nstay the registration of Hardie’s trademarks in Addisons name and two from\\norders allowing Addisons’ application for registration of Hardie’s device.\\nIn so far as the High Court affirmed the order of the Assistant Registrar\\nrejecting Hansa’s application for stay of the registration proceed-ings,\\nthe appeals have really become infructuous as the application for\\nregistration of Hardie’s trade marks was allowed by the Assistant Registrar\\nsubsequent to the decision of the Madras High Court. That decision is the\\nsubject matter of separate appeals before us and is dealt with\\nsubsequently. We confine our consideration only to the correctness of the\\ndecision of the High Court in so far as it affirmed the order of the\\nRegistrar granting registration of Hardie’s device in Addisons’s name.\\nThe Madras High Court held that since the device was not registered, the\\nonly right which could be claimed in opposition was the right of ’bare\\nuser’ of the device by Hansa subsequent to 1979. According to the High\\nCourt such user could not be countenanced as a valid ground for refusing\\nregistration of the device in Addison’s name as Hansa’s use of the device\\nwas only subsequent to the consent order in the Calcutta suit with full\\nknowledge of the pendency of the Addison’s application for registration of\\nthe device.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 14 of 17\\nWhat appears to have been overlooked by the High Court is that irrespective\\nof whether Hardie and Hansa were able to prove their right to use the\\ndevice in question, the merits of the applications of Addisons for\\nregistration would have to be independently assessed by the Registrar under\\nSection 18 of the Act. It was for Addisons to have adduced evidence in\\nsupport of its applications for registration, first, that it was the\\nproprietor of the device and second, that the device had been used by it or\\nthat it had a bona fide intention to use the device. Concentrating only on\\nHardie’s and Hansa’s claim, the Court appears to have proceeded on the\\nbasis that once the objections of Hardie and Hansa to the application for\\nregistration were overruled, Addisons’ applications for registration of the\\ndevice were to be allowed automatically. Apart from the fallacious\\napproach, we are of the view that the conclusion of the majority on the\\nquestion of Hardie’s and Hansa’s right to use the device in question was\\nincorrect.\\nThere is no dispute that the device was invented by Hardie or its\\npredecessor-in-interest prior to 1926. There is also no dispute that the\\ndevice is registered in Hardie’s name in Australia and New Zealand and that\\nHardie has been using the device all these years in the international\\nmarket. The High Court has erroneously held that Hardie never used the mark\\nand had never by itself manufactured and marketed the goods, namely paints\\nand other allied products in India either under the word marks or under the\\ndevice. In our narration of facts at the outset, we have noted that\\nadmittedly Hardie had sold the products manufactured by it through Addisons\\nbetween the period 1946 to 1949 pursuant to the collaboration agreement. It\\nis noody’s case that Hardie’s products when they were marketed in India\\nthrough Addisons were not under the registered marks and device.\\nIt is well established that if the manufacturer was the first to use the\\ndevice as a trade mark, he alone can claim property over the name as a\\ntrade mark3. The factual findings of the High Court that Hardie had never\\nmarketed goods manufactured by it in India was, therefore, not only wrong\\nbut it had serious repercussions on the maintainability on Addison’s\\napplication for registration. The High Court did not give sufficient\\nimportance to the fact that Hardie continued to be the registered\\nproprietor of the device outside this country. This coupled with the fact\\nthat the initial entry of Hardie’s goods was made under the trade marks\\nmuch prior to Addisons even setting up its factory, would put Addisons’\\nclaim for registration of the device as proprietor in considerable doubt.\\nThere has been no discussion on this aspect of the matter at all by the\\nHigh Court.\\nWe then come to the question of actual use of the device by Addisons. Till\\n1971 the collaboration agreement was in operation. Clause 16 of the\\nagreement provided :\\n\"All labels used in connection with surface coatings manufactured or\\nmarketed by Addison shall bear the correct name of such surface coatings\\nand shall prominently display the trade marks of Hardie Trading. The final\\ndesign of such labels shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto.\\nThe design which was agreed to, included not only the registered trademarks\\nbut also the device.\\n3. See. Law of Trade Marks (Trade Marks Act 1999) and Passing Off by P.\\nNarayanan Fifth Edition P. 34.\\nAddisons also stated in its application for rectification :\\n\"It may be mentioned here that prior to December, 1971, for about 25 years,\\nthe applicants were using, under a collaboration agree-ment, a trade mark\\ncontaining a device of a -warrior and the legend Spartan.\"\\nThis was obviously why in Addison’s advertisements issued in severalhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 15 of 17\\nnewspapers in 1971 the device has been crossed out and the public\\nintroduced to the new brand name of the word Addisons with the picture of\\nthe standing warrior.\\nThe registered user agreement was not put an end to by the agreement for\\nassignment as contended by Addisons. The assignment was conditional upon\\nthe payment of consideration and it is not even Addison’s case that any\\nconsideration was paid to Hardie. Besides the assignments were never\\nregistered as Section 44 mandates and it is doubtful whether the documents\\npertaining to assignment were at all admissible as evidence under Section\\n44(3), which expressly excludes unregistered assignments from being\\naccepted as evidence. Moreover, the episode regarding the aborted assign-\\nment had taken place in 1967 and the renouncement of the marks and device\\nby Addisons was in 1971, four years subsequent thereto. Had there been any\\nassignment of the trademarks in 1967, why did Addisons ask for Hardie’s\\npermission to use the trademarks between 1968 to 1971 and renounce such\\nuser in 1971?\\nAs with the registered word marks ’Spartan’ and ’Spartan Velox’, no\\nevidence has been brought on record by Addisons to show that it had ever\\ntaken any steps, apart from making the applications for registration, to\\nuse Hardie’s device of warrior-rear subsequent to 1971 right up to the time\\nit made its application for registration in December 1977. There is also no\\nevidence that Addisons had attempted to use the device subsequent to 1977\\nto 1979 when the consent order was passed in the Calcutta suit.\\nThe consent order was misunderstood and misinterpreted by the Madras High\\nCourt. The consent order which is dated 22nd February 1979 reads as follows\\n:\\n\"Upon reading an application of the plaintiffs pursuant to the notice dated\\nthe twenty second day of November, one thousand nine hundered and seventy\\neight and upon hearing Mr. B.N. Sen (Mr. Bhaskar Sen appearing with him)\\nadvocate for the plaintiffs and Mr. D.K. De (Mr. K. Ganguly appearing with\\nhim) advocate for the defendant and upon the defendant by its advocate\\nunder-taking to this Court that the defendant shall not use the mark\\nSpartan and the device Warrior referred to in paragraph 5 of the statement\\nof case annexed to the affidavit in opposition of the defendant, affirmed\\nby Vaithinatha Ranga Krishna on the twenty first day of December, one\\nthousand and nine hundred and seventy eight till the disposal of this suit\\nor until further order of this Court.\\nIt is ordered that the defendant shall be at liberty and entitled to use\\nthe warrior device which the defendant got registered in its name and it is\\nfurther ordered that the plaintiffs shall not object to the defendant\\nselling its products under the get up in which it is selling its products.\\nAnd it is further ordered that similarly the defendant shall not object to\\nthe plaintiffs selling their products under any get up so long as they\\ndistinguish their goods from those of the defendant. And it is further\\nordered that the parties herein shall be at liberty to apply before this\\nCourt for necessary directions if so advised. And it is further ordered\\nthat the costs of and incidental to this application be costs in the suit.\"\\nTherefore, Addisons voluntarily undertook to the High Court that it would\\nnot use the mark ’Spartan’ or the device of the warrior-rear until the\\ndisposal of the suit. It is not in dispute that the suit is still pending.\\nIt has never been and is not Addisons’ case that the consent was obtained\\nby any fraud or by exerting undue pressure. In fact on 30th April 1982,\\nthere is an order of the High Court of Calcutta which records Addisons’\\nreiteration that it would not use the mark warrior-rear which was claimed\\nby Hardie and Hansa. Irrespective of whether these orders sanctioned the\\nuse of warrior-rear by Hansa and Hardie, the question is whether they show\\nthat Addisons had ever used or showed any intention to use the device of\\nwarrior-rear in respect of which the applications for registration had been\\nmade. The consent order also records that Addisons would be entitled to usehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 16 of 17\\nthe warrior standing device which was registered in his name and Hardie and\\nHansa would not object to Addisons, \"selling its products under the get up\\nin which it is selling its products\". Therefore, till 1979 the \"get up\"\\nunder which Addisons was selling its products was not under the device of\\nthe warrior-rear.\\nThe third part of the consent order is that Addisons would not object to\\nHardie and Hansa selling their products as long as they distinguish their\\ngoods from those of Addisons. Pursuant to the consent order dated 22nd\\nFebruary 1979 w.e.f. 3rd September 1979 Hansa started using the ’Spartan’\\ntrade mark with the warrior device of Hardie on the products manufactured\\nby it and has continued to do so.\\nIt has not been shown to us how a consent order differs from any other form\\nof agreement except that it may have additional sanctity by reason of the\\nimprimatur of the Court. And yet, the High Court came to the conclusion\\nthat Hansa’s use of the device subsequent to the consent order was \"by\\nbrute use in controversial circumstances\". We are at a loss to understand\\nhow the High Court could have deduced that the use of the mark by Hansa\\nduring the pendency of the proceedings was not bona fide.\\nThe High Court in wrongly casting the onus on Hardie and Hansa by saying\\nthat they had not been able to produce \"any other relevant material to\\nindicate that there was no bona fide intention on the part of Addisons to\\nuse the mark at the time when they made their applications\" did not\\nconsider whether Addisons had positively proved its use and intention to\\nuse the device.\\nWe are of the view that the dissenting judgment of Swamidurai, J. was\\ncorrect. The learned Judge had correctly emphasised that Hardie had\\nmanufactured and was the first to market its goods under its registered\\ntrade mark and device in India. The learned Judge also correctly construed\\nthe consent order. No one had frog-marched Addisons into giving its\\nconsent. That is also not Addisons’ case. There are other factual errors in\\nthe majority view but it is not necessary to go into those as what we have\\nfound is sufficient to set aside the decision impugned and to allow the\\nappeals.\\nEven if we had held in Addisons’ favour on all other points we would have\\nthought that this was a fit case where the Assistant Registrar should have\\nexercised his discretion under Section 18 and rejected Addisons’\\napplication for registration. Not only was no positive proof of an\\nintention to use the device or the trade marks adduced by Addisons but the\\nevidence shows a conscious abandonment of the device in 1971 by the\\nissuance of the public advertisemetns. When did Addisons’ intention to use\\nthe device form? What was the necessity to revive the use of the device\\nmark in respect of paints after an interval of almost 7 years? The answer\\nto these issues would be relevant on the question of the bona fide of the\\nAddisons’ applications and yet was neither raised nor considered either by\\nthe Registrar or by the High Court. On the other hand taking into\\nconsideration the continued user of the mark since 1979 by Hansa, it should\\nhave been assumed that the device had over the period of so many years\\nbecome distinctive of Hansa’s product and therefore to allow registration\\nof the device in Addisons name might deceive the public.\\nWe, therefore, allow these appeals and set aside the decision of the High\\nCourt without any order as to costs.\\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 5312-A & 12A-E OF 1993\\nThere is no dispute that the marks which were the subject matter of\\nAddison’s application for registration before the Registrar of trademarks\\nat Madras were identical with Hardie’s marks of Spartan and Spartan Velox.\\nAlthough, the appellant has impugned the decision of the Registrar inter\\nalia on the ground that the order passed by the Registrar on 2nd June, 1992http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 17 of 17\\nwas without notice to the appellant and in violation of Section 102 of the\\nAct, it is not necessary to express any opinion on the submissions. The\\nappeals must be allowed on the short ground that we have held that hardie’s\\ntrademarks could not have been removed from the Register and as long as the\\nregistration of the marks continue in the name of Hardie, the application\\nfor registration of the same marks in the absence of any plea of bonafide\\nconcurrent user under Section 12 would not arise.\\nThese appeals are therefore allowed and the order of the Registrar at\\nMadras is set aside.',\n",

Gautam, Adv.\\nB E F O R E\\nHON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. DEEPAK GUPTA\\nDate of hearing &\\nJudgment & Order : 18th March, 2015.\\nWhether fit for reporting : Yes No\\n√\\nJUDGMENT & ORDER(OraL)\\nThis appeal for enhancement of compensation by the claimant\\nis directed against the judgment and award dated 26.08.2009 passed by\\nthe learned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, West Tripura, Agartala in\\nT.S(MAC) No.229 of 2006 whereby the Tribunal has awarded compensation2\\nof Rs.1,52,153/- along with interest @ 6% per annum in favour of the\\nclaimant.\\n[2] The admitted facts are that the claimant was working as a\\nwelder and suffered injuries in a motor vehicle accident. Due to the\\naccident he suffered injuries in his eye and loss of vision in one eye and the\\nmedical disability board has assessed the disability at 30% (permanent).\\n[3] I have seen the disability certificate and it clearly indicates\\nthat the claimant has lost vision in one eye. No doubt he can continue to\\nwork as a welder but there is bound to be loss of income.\\n[4] It is well settled law that in a case of injuries compensation is\\nawarded under two heads; pecuniary damages and non-pecuniary\\ndamages. Under the head of pecuniary damages, the expenses of\\ntreatment, attendants, special diet, transportation, hospitalization will be\\ncovered. Under the head of pecuniary losses, the claimant will also be\\nentitled to the amount of income which he has actually lost due to his being\\nunable to attend his work and in case, the injury has caused a permanent\\ndisability, then the future loss of income shall also have to be considered.\\nUnder the head of non-pecuniary damages, normally damages will be\\nawarded under the head of pain and suffering and in cases of permanent\\ndisability also for loss of amenities of life and future discomfort in life. In\\ncases where the claimant is a young unmarried person and the injuries\\naffect his marital prospects, damages for loss of marital prospects can also\\nbe awarded.\\n[5] Applying the aforesaid principles I now proceed to assess the\\ncompensation under the different heads.\\nMAC App. No. 82 of 2009 Page 2 of 53\\n[6] The accident took place on 29.04.2006. The claimant was\\nadmitted to the I.G.M Hospital in the eye ward on the same date and was\\ndischarged on 04.05.2006 and he was referred to the Sri Sankaradeva\\nNethralaya, Guwahati because the hospital at Tripura could not deal with\\nthe injury. The claimant thereafter with escorts went to Sri Sankaradeva\\nNethralaya, Guwahati and he was admitted there on 19.05.2006 and\\ndischarged on the same day itself. He was asked to visit again on the next\\nday and medication was prescribed. From the diagnosis it is apparent that\\nhe has lost full vision in one eye.\\n[7] The income of the claimant has been assessed at Rs.3500/-\\nper month which is not disputed. The claimant has not been awarded any\\namount for his hospitalization at Agartala. He remained in hospital at\\nAgartala for 6(six) days. He would have required attendants round the\\nclock. Even if the cost of one attendant is taken at Rs.250/- per day, the\\ncost of two attendants works out to Rs.500/- per day and for 6(six) days\\ncost of attendants at Agartala works out to Rs.3000/-. The claimant went to\\nGuwahati from Agartala and remained there for at least 12(twelve) days.\\nHe would have had to arrange for boarding, lodging for himself and his\\nattendants and even conservatively taking the expenses at Rs.1000/- per\\nday, he is awarded Rs.12,000/- for the expenses at Guwahati. Therefore,\\nthe total expenditure for treatment both at Agartala and at Guwahati works\\nout to Rs.15,000/-.\\n[8] The claimant went to Guwahati by bus and he claimed only\\nRs.2190/- for transportation charges. It is indeed shocking that the Tribunal\\neven did not grant him this amount on the ground that he was only entitled\\nMAC App. No. 82 of 2009 Page 3 of 54\\nto one escort. When a person is taken for treatment outside the State it is\\nnot necessary that only one escort accompany that person. Therefore, I see\\nno reason why the full amount as claimed should not be granted. In fact, I\\nfeel that there must have been some other expenses in respect of\\ntransportation and therefore, I awarding Rs.5000/- under the head of\\ntransportation.\\n[9] Next come the issue on medicines. The learned Tribunal has\\nawarded a sum of Rs.1813/- for medicinal expenses. Keeping in view the\\nnature of injuries and the treatment I awarding Rs.5000/- under this head.\\n[10] As far as loss of income on account of loss of vision of one\\neye is concerned, the calculations made by the Tribunal and the award of\\nRs.1,38,600/- under this head are proper and call for no enhancement.\\n[11] Shockingly, the learned Tribunal has not awarded any amount\\nfor pain and suffering or for loss of amenities and future discomfort in life.\\nThe claimant remained in hospital for six days at Agartala. He then went to\\nGuwahati. He had to remain outside the station for about 10 days along\\nwith his escorts. He is, therefore, awarded Rs.10,000/- under the head of\\npain and suffering.\\n[12] Lastly, comes the question of compensating the claimant for\\nthe permanent disability suffered by him. The claimant is blind in one eye\\nfor the rest of his life. God forbid, if anything happens to his second eye he\\nwill become totally blind. He is without vision in one eye and this can affect\\nhim in many ways, therefore, I awarding Rs.35,000/- under the head of\\nfuture discomfort and loss of amenities in life.\\nMAC App. No. 82 of 2009 Page 4 of 55\\n[13] The total compensation is, therefore, assessed at Rs.\\n(15,000/- + 5,000/- + 5,000/- + 1,38,600/- + 10,000/- + 35,000/-) =\\nRs.2,08,600/-. The award is accordingly enhanced from Rs.1,52,153/- to\\nRs.2,08,600/- i.e. by Rs.56,447/- which is rounded off to Rs.56,500/-. The\\nclaimant shall also be entitled to interest on the enhanced sum of\\nRs.56,500/- @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition\\ntill deposit of the amount. The insurance company is directed to deposit the\\nenhanced amount of compensation along with proportionate interest\\nthereupon in the Registry of this Court within four months from today.\\nObviously, the insurance company shall be entitled to adjust the amount(s),\\nif any, which it has already paid or deposited.\\n[14] The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms. No order as\\nto costs.\\nSend down the lower Court records forthwith.\\nCHIEF JUSTICE\\nMAC App. No. 82 of 2009 Page 5 of 5',\n",

              " \"WRIT PETITION 2480/2005\\n-----------\\nBefore Mr. Justice Dipak Misra.\\n22 June, 2005.\\nSMT. JANKI BAI ...Petitioner*\\nv.\\nPREM NARAYAN KUSHWAHA ...Respondent\\nAmarjeet Kaur v. Harbhajan Singh and another3; followed.\\nArvind Singh, for the petitioner.\\nAshok Lalwani, for the respondent.\\nCur. adv. vult.\\nORDER\\nDIPAK MISRA, J:–The respondent-husband filed an application for divorce under\\nSection 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 [for brevity 'the Act'] and the petitioner-wife\\ninitiated civil action under Section 24 of the Act before the learned 4th Additional District\\nJudge, Chhatarpur forming the subject-matter of H.M. Case No.13-A/2003. During the\\npendency of the said proceedings the wife-petitioner filed an application under Section\\n24 of the Act for grant of interim maintenance and litigation expenses. The learned\\nDistrict Judge by order dated 25-4-2003 granted maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.\\n500/- per month and Rs. 1000/- towards litigation expenses.\\nAfter the said order was passed as per Annexure-P/1 the respondent filed an\\napplication under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure [for short 'the CPC'] on\\n15-9-2003 highlighting that the behaviour of the wife/non-applicant was extremely cruel\\nto him and in fact, she had tried to extinguish his life spark by administering poisonous\\nsubstance to the wheat. The husband lodged an FIR at the concerned Police Station which\\nregistered a crime under Section 328 of the Indian Penal Code [in short 'the IPC] and got\\nher arrested. The learned Sessions Judge by judgment dated 5-9-2003 passed in Sessions\\nTrial No. 271/2002 convicted her for the offence and sentenced her to undergo rigorous\\nimprisonment for three years and ordered her to pay a fine of Rs. 1000/-. It was\\ncontended as conviction has been recorded against the wife she would not be entitled to\\nmaintenance and, therefore, the order of interim maintenance should be vacated and he\\nbe discharged from paying maintenance allowance.\\nThe petitioner filed a reply on 7-10-2003 to the application filed under Section 151\\nof the CPC and controverted the allegation. It was put forth that an appeal against the\\norder of conviction has been preferred before the appellate Court and the said appeal has\\nbeen admitted. She has been enlarged on bail and hence, the order granting maintenance\\nallowance by the Court below has to be confirmed and there was no justification or\\nwarrant to recall the order. The learned Trial Judge took note of the conviction and\\nallowed the application of the husband-respondent as per inpugned order dated 13-11-\\n2003 contained in Annexure-P/4. The Court below allowed the application directingstoppage of grant of maintenance allowance from the date of order but did not overturn\\nthe order as per the grant of litigation expenses.\\nIt is contended in the petition that the order passed by the learned 4th Additional\\nDistrict Judge, Chhatarpur is vitiated as the said order clearly exposits non-application of\\nmind. It is stand in the petition that the petition had been enlarged on bail during trial and\\nalso after conviction and hence, it would not be presumed that she is innocent, on that\\nground the maintenance allowance should not be stopped.\\nI have heard Mr. Arvind Singh, leaned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Ashok\\nLalwani, learned counsel for the respondent.\\nMr. Singh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has propounded that the\\nlearned Family Judge has grossly erred by recalling the order since the subsequent factum\\nthat has been taken note of does not really come within the ambit and sweep of change\\nthat would have any kind of effect or import on grant of maintenance allowance as\\nenvisaged in Section 24 of the Act. It is proponed by him that the concept of discretion\\nhas been broadened by the Court below beyond the statutory provision which is\\nimpermissible and hence, the order has to pave the path of vitiation.\\nMr. Lalwani, learned counsel appearing for the husband-respondent submitted that if\\nthe language of Section 24 is read in the proper perspective, it would go a long way to\\nshow that in every case the Court is not obligated to grant maintenance allowance and the\\npower invested with the Court is discretionary. Pyramiding the aforesaid submission, it is\\ncanvassed by him that the conditions precedent with regard to the finding of\\ninsufficiency of income in an independent manner for the purpose of maintaining\\noneself and to fight the litigation is not in absolute terms and, therefore, the conduct of a\\nparty is to be taken note of for grant of the same and as in the instant case, the wife has\\ntried to poison the husband, she does get herself incurably disentitled to get the benefit as\\nengrafted under the statute. The learned counsel further submitted that Sections 24 and 25\\nof the Act should be read in a conjoint manner to understand the legislative intent and,\\ntherefore, the concept of conduct in its conceptual eventuality and connotative expanse\\ncannot be totally ostracised or its effect absolutely modernized as that would tantamount\\nto frustrating the basic imperative of grant of maintenance.\\nThus, the centripodal and the pivotal issue that arises for consideration in this writ\\npetition preferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of India–whether the learned\\nFamily Judge of Family Court at Jabalpur is correct and sound in recalling the order\\ngranting maintanance pendente lite, under Section 24 of the Act on the foundation that\\nthe wife has been convicted under Section 328 of the IPC for administering poison to the\\nhusband, who has sought divorce by filing an application under Section 13(1) of the Act\\n?\\nTo appreciate the rival submissions raised at the Bar, it is necessary to refer Section\\n24 of the Act which reads as under:\\n''24 Maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceeding-Where in any\\nproceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the\\nhusband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his\\nsupport and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the applicationof the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the\\nexpenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as,\\nhaving regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent it\\nmay seem to the Court to be reasonable.''\\nOn a plain reading of Section 24, it is clear as crystal that the Court is required to\\nsee that either the wife or the husband has no independent income sufficient for her or\\nhis support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding and thereafter it has to fix the\\nmonthly allowance and the sum towards expenses of the proceeding which has to be\\ndone having due regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent.\\nIt needs no special emphasis to state that the reference to the petitioner's income and the\\nincome of the respondent has a connectivity with the person who has submitted the\\napplication. The applicant becomes the petitioner and the other party becomes the\\nrespondent. Two aspects have to be kept in view: first, if the applicant has no\\nindependent income to support himself or herself and the second, whether he has the\\nmeans and the necessary expenses to contend the proceeding. To put it differently, one\\nmust have the capacity to fight the litigation. The 'support' does mean an amount which is\\nsufficient for subsistence and reasonable living. The submission of learned counsel for\\nthe respondent is that the Court has the discretion, inasmuch as the Legislature has used\\nthe words ''it may'' and, therefore, even if the two statutory conditions are satisfied, the\\nCourt may decline to grant maintenance allowance and litigation expenses. It is\\ncontended by him that while deciding and application under Section 24, if the Court is of\\nthe firm view that the wife has been living an unchaste life, she is not entitled to claim\\nany maintenance pendente lite or expenses of litigation. It is also put forth by him that if\\nmaterial comes on record that an adulterer supports the wife, she being living in adultery,\\ncould not be entitled to maintanance. I may hasten to state here that none of the counsels\\nquestioned the correctness of the relating to jurisdiction to recall and I am inclined to\\nthink rightly so, since it would be neither legal nor just and proper to limit the wide\\ndiscretionary power conferred on the Court under Section 24 of the Act by holding that\\nthe Court has no power to modify or very its order awarding interim maintenance even on\\nproof of changed circumstances. [Laxmi Priya Rout v. Kama Prasad Rout1].\\nThe real crux and thrust of the matter is whether the discretion to recall under\\nchanged circumstance would include a conviction. To elaborate: whether the Court can\\ntake note of any circumstances which is extraneous to the provision. It is a cardinal\\nprinciple of law that if the provision is clear and unambiguous, it is to be interpreted as\\nit is without adding any word to it. Be it noted here that in certain cases, namely, Surjit\\nKaur v. Tirath Singh2, and in certain other cases it has been observed that though the\\nwords ''conduct of the parties'' do not appear in the present Section, yet the conduct of\\nthe parties would not be ignored by the Court in making the order asked for or for\\nassessing the amount of allimony. The matter is one for the Court to deal with as it\\nthinks just and reasonable in its unfettered discretion. It has been held that certain\\nrelevant circumstances including adultery and the wife who has brought cohabitation to\\nan end for which the husband cannot be blamed, and the conduct of the erring spouse\\nthat has caused exceptional hardship to the other or, where the erring spouse is shown to\\nhave been guilty of exceptionally depraved, the Court may refuse to grant alimony\\npendente lite. Whether the discretion of the Court can be stretched to that extent at the\\nstage of entertaining an application under Section 24 is to be seen.On a reading of the provision, there can be no scintilla of doubt that the Court has\\nthe discretion, but the discretion has to be used keeping in view judicial conscience and\\nfairplay and not in an arbitrary or capricious manner. The discretion that has been vested\\nwith the Court cannot travel beyond the statutory requirement. The Court cannot\\nintroduce a condition and conceive that the conduct of either of the spouses can be taken\\nnote of while awarding interim maintenance. The language in which Sections 24 and 25\\nare couched is quite different. The word ''may'' engrafted into the anatomy of the\\nprovision would not clothe the Court with the jurisdiction to take into any other facet\\nwhich has a connectivity with the conception of ''conduct''. ''Conduct is not a necessitous\\nrequirement for the purpose of grant of interim maintenance. The discretion that is\\nvested with the Court has inseparable nexus with the conditions precedent and the\\nreasonableness of the quantum. In this context, I may fruitfully reproduce a passege from\\nthe decision rendered in the case of Dwarkadas Gurumukhdas Agrawal v. Bhanuben1.\\n''2......In other words , is the Matrimonial Court entitled to negative the claim of\\nmaintenance pendente lite merely on the ground of the averments in the petition\\nor the allegations against the wife ? The answer to this question depends on the\\nreal nature of this right of a spouse to claim maintenance pending the\\nproceedings. The right of a wife in general for maintenance is an incidence of\\nthe status of matrimony. The husband in general is under an obligation to defray\\nthe wife's costs of any proceedings and to prove her with maintenance and\\nsupport during the pending legal proceedings under Hindu Marriage Act.\\nAlimony strictly speaking is a maintenance allowance given to a wife by husband\\non separation. It is well recognised in civilised society that a wife having no\\nindependent means of subsistence and maintenance is entitled to alimony\\npending matrimonial proceedings and costs thereof. It is this principle which has\\nbeen incorporated in S.24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. As a matter of fact the\\nSection goes beyond the classical concept to the doctrine of alimony inasmuch\\nas it recognises the right even of a husband who has no sufficient means for his\\nsupport to claim alimony pending the proceedings from a wife having means.\\nThe opening words of Se. 24 invests a spouse lacking sufficient means for his or\\nher support to claim maintenance pendante lite and the costs and expenses of the\\nproceedings under the Act which includes, inter alia, for divorce or nullity of\\nvoid of voidable marriage. On the plain reading of S.24, alimony is a\\nconcomitant of a marriage in fact. On an admission or proof of factum of\\nmarriage, alimony is a right or either of the spouses lacking means of his or her\\nsupport. It would be no answer to such claim that the marriage is void or\\nvoidable. It would be imprudent on the part of the Court to ignore the principle\\nthat a defacto marriage necessarily carried a right to alimony pendente lite for an\\nincapacitated spouse and the ultimate outcome of substantive proceedings cannot\\nhave a back-fire so as to negative such a right. If the allegation, or for that matter\\nthe conduct of the party claiming maintenance or expenses pending the\\nproceedings is allowed to have such an over-bearing effect so as to negative such\\na claim it would be tantamount to prejudging the issues which is to be tried in the\\nsubstantive proceedings.''\\nIn this context, I may very usefully refer to the decision rendered in the case of Mrs.\\nBijal Parag Dave v. Parag Labhashankar Dave1, wherein it has been laid down as under:\\n''While considering the application for maintenance pendente lite, the only\\nconsideration before the Court in inability of the spouse to maintain herself orhimself for want of financial means or inadequacy of financial means to\\nmaintain at the level of social status of the other spouse from whom interim\\nmaintenance is sought and not the misconduct of the applicant spouse because in\\nthe matrimonial dispute between spouses, there would always be allegation of\\nmatrimonial offence or misconduct. If misconduct of the spouse seeking\\nmaintenance pendente lite could be relevant factor, in no proceeding of divorce\\nor dissolution of marriage or judicial separation, the opponent spouse unable to\\nmaintain could seek interim maintenance since there would always be allegation\\nof matrimonial misconduct against him or her in such proceeding. This was\\nnever and is not legislative intention of S.24. While enacting S.24, the legislature\\nhas provided the interim measure to the spouse having no means or inadequate\\nmeans to seek maintenance from the spouse who has means to pay the same since\\nbecause of matrimonial dispute till its resolution by the Court, such affected\\nparty must be able to maintain herself or himself and contest the proceedings.\\nThe proceedings under S.24 of Hindu Marriage Act are summary in nature and\\nat this stage, the Court cannot embark upon the enquiry about the misconduct of\\nthe spouse claiming maintenance or commission of marital offence. It is that\\ngranting interim maintenance under S.24 of Hindu Marriage Act is a matter of\\ndiscretion but like all other discretions exercisable by the Court, this discretion\\ntoo has to be exercised judicially and in accordance with law. The consideration\\nof a factor which does not flow from a statutory provision if take into\\nconsideration while exercising discretion, such exercise of discretion cannot be\\nsaid to have been exercised in accordance with law. In the instant case the trial\\nCourt has committed the mistake by taking into consideration the conduct of\\nwife while considering application under S.24 and therefore, the order impugned\\nin the writ petition refusing to award maintenance pendente lite to the wife on the\\nground of misconduct cannot be sustained.''\\nIn the case of Amarjeet Kaur v. Harbhajan Singh and another1, their Lordships\\nwhile dealing with the order of the High Court where a condition was imposed while\\ngranting maintenance and litigation expenses directed the Court below to order for\\nconducting the DNA test of the male child which is in custody of the petitioner with the\\nfurther rider that if the test goes against, the petitioner therein, should not be entitled to\\nget any maintenance pendente lite for herself, but would get maintenance for the girl\\nchild which was fixed at Rs. 1,000/- per month. In the context it was contended before\\nthe Apex Court that in the matter of grant of maintenance, there is no impendiment for\\nthe Court to impose a condition of the nature and no exception could be taken to the\\ncourse adopted by the High Court. Their Lordships in paragraph 8 held as under:-\\n''8. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 empowers the Court in any\\nproceeding under the Act, if it appears to the Court that either the wife or the\\nhusband, as the case may be, has no independent imcome sufficient for her or his\\nsupport and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application\\nof any one of them order the other party to pay to the petitioner the expenses of\\nthe proceeding and monthly maintenance as may seem to be reasonable during\\nthe proceeding, having regard to also the income of both the petitioner and the\\nrespondent. Once the High Court, in this case, has come to the conclusion that\\nthe appellant wife herein has to be provided with the litigation expenses and\\nmonthly maintenance, it is beyond comprehension as to how, de hors the\\ncriterian laid down in the statutory provision itself, the Court could have thought\\nof imposing an extraneous condition, with a default clause which is likely todefeat the very claim which has been sustained by the Court itself.\\nConsiderations as to the ultimate outcome of the main proceeding after regular\\ntrial would be wholly alien to assess the need or necessity for awarding interim\\nmaintenance, as long as the marriage, the dissolution of which has been sought,\\ncannot be disputed, and the marital relationship of husband and wife subsisted.\\nAs noticed earlier, the relevant statutory consideration being only that either of\\nthe parties, who was the petitioner in the application under Section 24 of the Act,\\nhas no independent income sufficient for her or his support for the grant of\\ninterim maintenance, the same has to be granted and the discretion thereafter left\\nwith the Court, in our view, is only with reference to reasonableness of the\\namount that could be awarded and not to impose any condition, which has self-\\ndefeating consequence. Therefore, we are unable to approve of the course\\nadopted by the learned Single Judge, in this case.''\\nFrom the aforesaid pronouncement, it is evincible that their Lordships while\\nscanning the basic requirement of Section 24 of the Act have laid down that the relevant\\nstatutory consideration being only that either of the parties who was the petitioner in the\\napplication under Section 24 of the Act has no independent income sufficient for her or\\nhis support for the grant of interim maintenance, the same has to be granted and the\\ndiscretion therefore left with the Court is only with reference to the reasonableness of the\\namount that would be awarded and not to impose any condition which has self-defeating\\nconsequence. It is worth noting here that in paragraph 9 of the said judgment their\\nLordships dealt with the condition imposed, i.e. conducting a DNA test and expressed no\\nopinion on the legality and propriety of the Court undertaking consideration at the\\nappropriate stage. Their Lordships only confined to the limited aspect to the stage of\\nawarding interim maintenance. It may look that imposition of a condition while granting\\nmaintenance allowance can affect the provision thereof distinguishing features but a\\npregnant one, which their Lordships have categarically and unequivocally expressed the\\nopinion with regard to the requirement of statutory conditions. Their Lordships have\\nused the words '' the relevant statutory conditions being only.......'' and in view of the\\naforesaid I am disposed to think that no other condition can be read into the provision to\\nbe added as a futuristic conditional one or a conviction. Their Lordships have restricted\\nthe discretion to quantum, not to entitlement if the conditions precedent are proved. The\\nsubmission made by the learned counsel for the respondent that the conduct is a relevant\\nfact and has to be taken into consideration is de hors the provision, as Section 25 has\\nbeen couched in a different language than Section 24. Section 25 uses the\\nphraseology''......conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case''. Such\\nwordings are absent in the provision and in the absence of the same, it would be\\nencroaching in the field of legislation to add the said concepts to it on the basis that the\\nCourt has a discretion, more so, when the Apex Court has expressed the view with regard\\nto the limited discretion the Court has. In view of the constricted and restricted discretion\\non, the broader expanse that has been built up and the edifice that is sought to be\\npyramided by the learned counsel for the respondent have no legs to stand upon and\\nbound to collapse.\\nConsequently, the inevitable conclusion would be quashment of the impugned order\\nwhich I direct. The petitioner shall be entitled to the maintenance allowance and litigationexpenses as per the earlier order and the amount that has fallen due by virtue of quashing\\nof the impugned order shall be paid to the wife petitioner within a period of three\\nmonths. There shall be no order as to costs.\\nPetition disposed.\\n---------\",\n",

Shukla, for the petition.\\nS.K. Yadav, Govt. Adv. for the State.\\nCur. adv. vult.\\nORDER\\nDIPAK MISRA, J.:- By this writ petition the petitioner has called in question the legal\\nvalidity and propriety of the order dated 1-4-2002 contained in Annexure-A/11 whereby\\nthe earlier order dated 19-10-2001 dropping the departmental proceeding has been\\nrecalled and to issue a writ of certiorari for quashment of the same and further to issue a\\nwrit of mandamus to command the respondents to issue order of promotion in pursuance\\nof the recommendations of the DPC held on 15-10-2001 and further to open the sealed\\ncover of the DPC held in December, 2001 and post him on the post of Superintending\\nEngineer from the date of promotion extended to the respondent No.3.\\nThe facts as have been narrated in the petition need not be adumbrated in detail.\\nWhat is necessitous to be stated is that a proceeding was initiated against the petitioner\\nunder Rule 16 of the M.P. Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules,\\n1966 [for brevity \\'the Rules\\'] as per Annexure-A/1 dated 9-2-2000. The said proceeding\\nwas dropped on 19-10-2001. In the meantime, certain recommendations were given by\\nthe DPC for his promotion. When the matter stood thus, on 1-4-2002 vide Annexure-\\nA/11 the order of dropping the proceeding dated 19-10-2001 was recalled and direction\\nwas issued to take appropriate action against the petitioner. Thereafter as is revealed a\\nproceeding under Rule 14 has been initiated on 22-10-2002 as per Annexure-A/14.\\nMr. V.K. Shukla, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has submitted that\\nonce the proceeding was dropped after due consideration the same could not have been\\nrecalled. It is urged by him that by order of dropping the proceeding as is perceivable\\nfrom the Annexure-A/9 dated 19-10-2001 is founded on cogent and germane reasons and\\nhence, there was no justification or warrant to pass an order as per Annexure-A/11. In\\naddition contended Mr. Shukla that initiation of a departmental proceeding for major\\npunishment as per Annexure-A/14 is reeked with malafide and, therefore, unsustainable.\\nMr. S.K. Yadav, learned Govt. Advocate for the State has contended that the order\\nwhich has been recalled can be revived by exercise of power of review under Rule 29 of\\nthe Rules and such revival cannot be found fault with. It is contended by him that lack of\\njurisdiction which has been vehemently urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner is\\ntotally without any substance as such power rests with the reviewing authority.\\nSupporting the issue of a charge-sheet under Rule 14 of the Rules propounded Mr.\\nYadav, considering the totality of facts and circumstances the charge-sheet has beenserved and when the enquiry is in progress this Court should not enter into merits of this\\ncase, whether the charges are manifestly erroneous or not.\\nTo appreciate the rivalised submissions raised at the Bar, I have carefully perused\\nthe charge-sheet which was initially served on the petitioner. A free translation of the\\nsame in English would read as under:\\n\\'\\'It is hereby informed that during the posting as Executive Engineer, Public\\nWorks Department, Deosar Division, in the year 1995-96 against certain\\nirregularities a decision is taken to initiate action under rule 10 and 16 of the\\nMadhya Pradesh, Civil Services (Classification, control and Appeal) Rules, 1996.\\nThe details of misconduct on which the action is proposed is as under:\\nYou as an Executive Engineer Public Works Department, Deosar Division vide\\norder No. 108 dtd. 17-1-1995 No.20 dated 3-1-1996 and 4142 dated 30-12-1995\\nplaced an order for supply NP-3 Hume Pipes of different diameter to Laghu\\nUdyog Nigam accordingly, M.P. Laghu Udyog Nigam by an order No. 134219\\ndtd. 30-1-1996, No. 134221 dtd. 30-1-1996 and order No. 13422 dtd. 30-1-1996\\nordered M/s Satna Cement Pipe Works, Rahiya, Distit.Satna to supply NP-3 type\\nof Hume Pipes within 45 days. M/s Satna Cement Pipe works by letter dt. 12-3-\\n1996 informed about the completion of the work order. That by your letter dtd.\\n13-3-1996 it was informed that by mistake instead or Type NP-2 Type NP-3 has\\nbeen mentioned in the letter addressed to the Laghu Udyog Nigam, therefore,\\nNP-2 of various diameters may be supplied. By your letter dated 26-4-1996\\nsupplier was asked to supply the coller.\\nThe Divisional office has sought the permission for purchasing NP-3 type of\\nHume Piper, accordingly, Superintending Engineer, Rewa, accorded its sanction.\\nThat your act of passing an order for supply of Type NP-3 Human Pipe and then\\nin its place for supply of type NP-2 Hume Pipe is an irresponsible act reflecting\\nyour intention to cause loss to the firms is an act contrary to Rule 3(1) of the MP\\nCivil Service(Classification, Control and Appeal) 1965 Rules for which you are\\naccountable.\\nSince the irregularities are prima facie found on the basis of record and looking\\nto the seriousness of the matter, it is decided to impose a minor penalty as\\ncontemplated under M.P. Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal\\nRules, 1966).\\nTherefore, within 15 days of receiving of this notice you are called upon to\\nshow cause why a penalty of stoppage of one increment with non-cumulative\\neffect be imposed. Be it noted that in case no reply is filed within the time limit it\\nwill be presumed that you have no submission to make and the State will be at\\nliberty to take decision ex parte.\\'\\'\\nSubmission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the same could not have\\nbeen recalled and revived and dropping of the proceedings could not have been recalled.\\nPer contra, proponed the learned Government Advocate for the State that in\\nexercise of Rule 29 of the Rules the same can be reviewed. That being the sole crux of\\nthe matter, it is appropriate to reproduce Rule 29 of the Rules. It reads as under:\\'\\'29(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules except rule 11-\\n(i) the Governor;\\n(ii) the head of a department directly under the State Government, in the case of\\na Government servant serving in a department or office (not being the\\nsecretariat), under the control of such head of a department, or\\n(iii) the appellate authority, within six months of the date of the order proposed\\nto be reviewed, or\\n(iv) any other authority specified in this behalf by the Governor by a general or\\nspecial order, and within such time as may be prescibed in such general or\\nspecial order may at any time, either on his or its own motion or otherwise call\\nfor the records of any inquiry and review any order made under these rules or\\nunder the rules repealed by rule 34 from which an appeal is allowed but from\\nwhich no appeal has been preferred or from which no appeal is allowed, after\\nconsultation with the Commission where such consultation is necessary, and\\nmay-\\n(a) confirm, modify or set aside the order; or\\n(b) confirm, reduce, enhance or set aside the penalty imposed by the order, or\\nimpose any penalty where no penalty has been imposed, or\\n(c) remit the case to the authority which made the order or to any other authority\\ndirecting such authority to make such further inquiry as it may consider proper in\\nthe circumstances of the case; or\\n(d) pass other orders as it may deem fit;\\nProvided that no order imposing or enhancing any penalty shall be made by any\\nreviewing authority unless the Goverment servant concerned has been given a\\nreasonable opportunity of making a representation against the penalty proposed\\nand where it is proposed to impose; any of the penalties specified in clauses (v)\\nto (ix) of rule 10 or to enhance the penalty imposed by the order sought to be\\nreviewed to any of the penalties specified in those clauses, no such penalty shall\\nbe imposed except after an inquiry in the manner laid down in rule 14 and except\\nafter consultation with the Commission where such consultation is necessary :\\nProvided further that no power to review shall be exercised by the head\\nof department–\\n(i) the authority which made the order in appeal, or\\n(ii) the authority to which an appeal would lie, where no appeal has been\\npreferred, is subordinate to him.\\nExplanation. I–The powers conferred on the Governor under this sub-rule shall\\nin the case of a Class III or Class IV Government servant serving in a District\\nCourt or a Court Subordinate thereto be exercised by the Chief Justice.\\nExplanation II– The powers conferred on the Governor under this rule shall, in\\nthe case of Judicial Officers be exercised by the High Court.\\n(2) No proceeding for review shall be commenced until after–(i) the expiry of the period of limitation for an appeal, or\\n(ii) the disposal of the appeal where any such appeal has been preferred.\\n(3) An application for review shall be dealt with in the same manner as if it\\nwere an appeal under these rules.\"\\nIf the said Rule is understood in proper perspective and the review clause is\\nappreciated, there can be no trace of doubt that the reviewing authority can set aside the\\norder of recall and pass another punishment. In the case at hand, the departmental\\nproceeding was dropped and thereafter another proceeding has been initiated. Another\\nproceeding is sustainable or not, on the facts, cannot be gone into. As far as recall of the\\nproceeding is concerned, definitely no jurisdictional error can be found in it. Submission\\nof Mr. Shukla is that if the order of recall is quashed he would be entitled to get\\npromotion from the date of recommendation. That apart, contended Mr. Shukla, when\\nappropriate reasons are given and this Court would appreciate the facts in proper\\nperspective, there would be no difficulty to arrive at the conclusion that the order of\\nrecall was absolutely sustainable. What Mr. Shukla intends this Court to do at this stage\\nis to enter into the arena of facts to appreciate the factual scenario to record a\\ncounclusion on the merits of the case. At this juncture, I am inclined to think, it is\\nunwarrantable. When a reviewing authority has recalled the order and the power is within\\nhis jurisdictional domain, I am disposed to think the order contained in Annexure-A/11\\ninvulnerable and does withstand scrutiny.\\nIn view of the aforesaid premised reasons, I do not perceive any merit in this writ\\npetition and the same stands dismissed accordingly without any order as to costs.\\nPetition dismissed.\\n-----------',\n",

              " \"SECOND APPEAL NO. 396/1990\\n-----------\\nBefore Mr. Justice U.C. Maheshwari.\\n15 December, 2005.\\nBASODI ALIAS MUNSHILAL and another ...Appellants*\\nv.\\nSMT. MEERA BAI and others ...Respondents.\\nR.K. Nanhoriya, for the appellant.\\nAshish Shroti, for the respondent.\\nJUDGMENT\\nU.C. MAHESHWARI J:–Respondets/plaintiffs have preferred this appeal under\\nSection 100 of CPC being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated 17.1.1990,\\npassed by Additional District Judge, Harda Camp Sohagpur in Civil Regular Appeal\\nNo. 27-A/87 reversing the judgment and decree dated 9.12.1986 passed by Civil\\nJudge, Class-II, Sohagpur in Civil Original Suit No. 4-A/1984 regarding dismissal\\nof the suit.\\n2. This appeal was admitted by this Court on dated 29.11.1990 on the following substantial\\nquestions of law:\\n''Whether the decree for mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 50/- per month from the\\nyear 1981 to the date of delivery of possession granted by the first appellate\\nCourt in in excess of the claim made by the plaintiff in para 8 and relief clause\\n12(Kh) of the plaint ?''\\n3. The facts of the case are that Kishanlal the predecessor of the respondent's has filed a\\nsuit for possession and the mesne profit against appellants in respect of a plot situated on Survey\\nNo. 103 measuring 40' x 60' at village Ajabgaon, Tahsil Sohagpur. The mesne profit was claimed\\nat the rate of Rs. 120 per annum. In written statement of the appellant the averments of the\\nplaint are denied. The claim of mesne profit was also denied.\\n4. After framing the issues the evidence was recorded by the trial Court and on appreciation\\nof it the suit of the respondents was dismissed by the trial Court. On appeal the decree of the\\ntrial Court was set aside and the suit was decreed for possession and also for mesne profit @ of\\nRs. 50/-per month instead Rs. 120 per annum. Hence this appeal has been preferred and the same\\nwas admitted on the aforesaid substantial question of law.\\n5. Learned counsel for appellants has submitted that as per pleadings of the respondents in\\npara12 of the plaint,the mesne profit was claimed @ only Rs. 120 per annum thus appellate\\nCourt could not have been decreed more than this as the Court can not travel beyond the\\npleadings of the parties but contrary to this the mesne profit was awarded on a higher rate for\\nwhich sufficient reasons have also not been supplied by thus such finding is not sustainable\\nunder the law and prayed for setting aside the same.\\n6. While, other hand, Shri Ashish Shroti, Counsel for respondents has submitted that the suit\\nwas filed on 21.11.1984 and the appeal was decided on 17th January 1990 after more than six\\nyears. He fairly concedes that the mesne profit was claimed by respondents in the pleadings @\\nRs. 120 per annum but simultaneously his version was that it was mentioned only on the basis of\\ndate of the suit on available cause of action. So far subsequent mesne profit is concerned, the\\nCourts have vested discretionary jurisdiction to award the mesne profit by keeping in view the\\npendency and longevity of litigation and he placed his reliance on two decided cases of the\\nApex Court and prayed for dismissal of this appeal.\\n7. Having heard the learned counsels, I have gone through the record. It is true that the\\nplaintiff has claimed the mesne profit only @ Rs. 120 per annum but it is awarded Rs. 50 per\\nmonth i.e. Rs. 600 per annum. In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in the mater of\\nGopalakrishna Pillai and others v. Meenakshi Ayal and others [AIR 1967 SC 155], the Courts\\nare empowered to award the mesne profit on a higher rate in the facts and circumstances of the\\ncase. The Apex Court has held as under:\\n''7. Order 20 R.12 enables the Court to pass a decree for both past and future\\nmesne profits but there are important distinctions in the procedure for the\\nenforcement of the two claims. With regard to past mesne profits, a plaintiff has\\nan existing cause of action on the date of the institution of the suit. In view of\\nO.7 R.1 and 2 and O.7 R.7 of the Code of Civil Procedure and S.7(1) of the\\nCourt Fees Act, the plaintiff must plead this cause of action, specifically claim adecree for the past mesne profits, value the claim approximately; and pay Court-\\nfees thereon. With regard to future mesne profits the plaintiff has no cause of\\naction on the date of the institution of the suit, and it is not possible for him to\\nplead this cause of action or to value it or to pay Court-fees thereon at the time of\\nthe institution of the suit. Moreover, he can obtain relief in respect of this future\\ncause of action only in a suit to which the provisions of O.20 R.12 apply. But in\\na suit to which the provisions of O.20 R.12 apply, the Court has a discretionaly\\npower to pass a decree directing an inquiry into the future mesne profits, and the\\nCourt may grant this general relief, through it is not specifically asked for in the\\nplaint, see Basavayya v. Guruvayya [ILR, (1952) Mad 178 at P 177 : (AIR 1951\\nMad 938 at P. 940) (FB)]. In Fakharuddin Mohamed Ahsan v. Official Trustee of\\nBengal [(1982) ILF 8 Cal. 178 at P 189 (PC)], Sir R.P. Collier observed:\\n''The plaint has been already read in the first case, and their Lordships are of\\nopinion that it is at all events open to the construction that the plaintiff intended to\\nclaim wasilat up to the time of delivery of possesson, although, for the purpose\\nof valuation only, so much was valued as was than due; but be that as it may, they\\nare of opinion that, under S.196 of Act VIII of 1859, it was in the power of the\\nCourt if it though fit, to make a decree which should give the plaintiff wasilat up\\nto the date of obtaining possession.'' Section 196 of Act VIII of 1859\\nempowered the Court in a suit for land or other property paying rent to pass a\\ndecree for mesne profits from the date of the suit until the date of delivery of\\npossession to the decree holder. The observations of the Privy Council suggest\\nthat in a suit to which S. 196 of Act VIII of 1859 applied, the Court had\\njurisdiction to pass a decree for mesne profits though there was no specific claim\\nin the plaint for future mesne profits. The Court has the like power to pass a\\ndecree directing an inquiry into future mesne profits in a suit to which the\\nprovisions of O.20, R.12 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 apply.''\\nIn the aforesaid dictum of the Apex Court, it was said that mesne Profit can be\\nawarded in such case in which it was not prayed. Some amount was claimed by\\nrespondents but the same was awarded on higher rate but the aforesaid dictum\\nspeaks regarding discretionary power of the Court to award the future mesne profit.\\n8. Thus, at the time of judgment such power could be invoked by the Court to decide the\\nmesne profit on appropriate rate. But such power could have been invoked after inquiry and with\\nsufficient reasons, the same was not done by the appellate Court in the case at hand.\\n9. On Another occasion, in the matter of Marshall Sons & Co. (I) LTD. v. Sahi Oretrans\\n(P) Ltd and another [(1999) 2 SCC 325], the Apex Court has given the dictum for awarding the\\nmesne profit on higher rate as under:\\n''4. From the narration of the facts, though it appears to us, prima facie, that a\\ndecree in favour of the appellant is not being executed for some reason or the\\nother, we do not think it proper at this stage to direct the respondent to deliver the\\npossession to the appellant since the suit filed by the respondent is still pending. It\\nis true that proceedings are dragged for a long time on one Count or the other and,\\non occasion, become highly technical accompanied by unending prolixity at every\\nstage providing a legal trap to the unwary. Because of the delay, unscrupulous\\nparties to the proceedings take undue advantage and a person who is in wrongul\\npossession draws delight in delay in disposal of the cases by taking undue\\nadvantage of procedural complications. It is also a known fact that after obtaining\\na decree for possession of immovable property, its execution takes a long time. In\\nsuch a situation, for protecting the interest of the judgment-creditor, it is\\nnecessary to pass appropriate orders so that reasonable mesne profit which may be\\nequivalent to the market rent is paid by a person who is holding over the property.\\nIn appropriate cases, the Court may appoint a Receiver and direct the person who\\nis holding over the property to act as an agent of the Receiver with a direction to\\ndeposit the royalty amount fixed by the Receiver or pass such other order which\\nmay meet the interest of justice. This may prevent further injury to the palintiff in\\nwhose favour the decree is passed and to protect the property including further\\nalienation.''\\nIn the aforesaid case, the Apex Court has awarded the mesne profit on higher\\nrate at appellate stage in view of this settled law the appellate Court are within\\njurisdiction in awarding the mesne profit on higher rate but before awarding it the\\nperson concerned should be given an opportunity to hear on this question and in theinstant case on higher rate no opportunity was given to appellants. Thus for this\\nlimited purpose this matter requires some consideration.\\n10. Thus, the question involved in this appeal is answered accordingly. As discussed above, it\\nis held that the Courts have vested powers to award the mesne profit at the market rate for the\\nperiod pendentlite of the suit and till recovery of possession of property but by supplying the\\nsufficient reasons in the judgment or orders.\\n11. Hence this appeal partly allowed and only on the question of mesne profit the finding of\\nthe appellate Court is set aside and the case is remitted back to the trial Court with a direction to\\ndecide this question of mesne profit afresh after giving an opportunity for hearing and adducing\\nthe evidence to the parties. It be done within six months from the date of receiving the record\\nand intimation of this order.\\n12. The appeal is partly allowed. There shall be no orders as to costs. Decree be drawn up\\naccordingly.\\nAppeal partly allowed.\\n---------------\",\n",

Choubey, for the respondent.\\nCur. adv. vult.\\nJUDGMENT\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\\nU.C. MAHESHWARI, J:–The appellant/plaintiff has preferred this appeal under Section\\n96 of Civil Procedure Code being aggrieved by the order dated 24.2.1998 passed by\\nDistrict Judge, Jabalpur in Civil Original Suit No. 43-A/1996 whereby suit for partition,\\npossession, declaration and perpetual injunction has been dismissed by allowing the\\napplication under Order 7 Rule 11 of C.P.C. filed by respondent No.1, 2, 4 and 5.\\nThe facts giving rise to this appeal are that the plaintiff, the son of respondent\\nNo.3 and nephew of respondent No.2, 4 and 5 and grand son of respondent No.1, filed\\nthe present suit for partition, possession, declaration and perpetual injunction regarding\\nhouse property bearing house No. 569 (old No.664, 665 and 666), situated at\\nBhaldarpura, Sarafa Ward, Jabalpur. According to the plaint assertions Late Mool Chand\\nJain died before 90 years and his son Lalchand Jain, died before 50 years leaving behind\\nthree sons namely, Late Pannalal Jain, Prem Chand Jain and Shikhar Chand Jain. The\\nancestral property was divided by Late Lal Chand Jain in his life time amongst his sons,\\nPanna Lal and premchand were given some other properties while house in dispute was\\ngiven to the youngest son Late Shri Shikhar Chand Jain who died on 5.12.1958 and\\nthereafter being his legal representatives his wife respondent No.1, Smt. Ladli Bahu and\\nsons respondent No.2 Padman Kumar; respondent No.3 Pushp Kumar Jain, respondent\\nNo.4 Pawan Kumar Jain and respondent No.5 Chand Kumar Jain inherited the said\\nhouse. It has also been pleaded that this being the ancestral property they all have equal\\nshares being coparcener. It is further pleaded that Lalchand Jain had purchased this house\\non 28.1.1937 and on his demise it has become ancestral property.\\nIt is further set forth in the plaint that after demise of said Shikhar Chand Jain on\\n30.3.1972 a document which has been nomenclatured as ''Dastwari'' (Document of\\nrelinquishment) was executed by respondent no.2 to 5 in favour of respondent No.1 and\\nsame was registered as per prescribed procedure and subsequently a plan was prepared by\\nrespondent No.1, 2, 4 & 5 to transfer the property against the interest of respondent No.3\\nand same was implemented in different parts and as alleged before three years three\\nshops of disputed house were sold for consideration of rupees three lacs by executing a\\ndocument of transfer by respondent No.1. A part of this house was shown to be\\npurchased by respondent No.4 by way as registered deed dated 2.3.1989 andconsideration was arranged by availing loan from his employer M.P.E.B. at the\\nsubsequent stage other part of the property which was allegedly the share of respondent\\nNo.5 was also sold for consideration of rupees eight lacs and as per pleadings respondent\\nNo.1, 4 and 5 have already disposed of their shares and remaining property is only of\\nthe branch of respondent No.2 and 3.\\nIt is case of the plaintiff/appellant that he was born on 13.10.1977 and after\\nattaining majority he demanded his share by partition from respondent and same was not\\ngiven then the present suit was filed on 24.6.1996 for declaration partition separate\\npossession and perpetual injuction.\\nIn the written statement filed by respondent No.3, father of the appellant has\\nadmitted the claim of the appellant and accepted the execution of the deed of\\nrelinquishment in favour of his mother, respondent No.1 and also admitted the date of\\nbirth of the appellant and pleaded that he has no objection in decreeing the suit in favour\\nof the appellant.\\nThe respondent No.1, 2, 4 and 5 instead of filing the written statement, filed an\\napplication dated 11.2.97 under Order 7 Rule 11 of Civil Procedure Code averring that\\nthe appellant is claiming his share being son of respondent No.3 and as such his claim is\\nthrough his father and according to pleadings of the appellant it is an admitted fact that\\nrespondent No.3 had already executed a document dated 30.3.1972 in favour of\\nrespondent No.1 and relinquished his entire right, title, interest in the property in dispute\\nand the said document being binding against the appellant, the plaint was liable to be\\nrejected. It was further pleaded that the appellant being a son of respondent No.3 has no\\nindependent cause of action for filing the suit as he has no right in law. It was also said\\nthat admittedly appellant was born on 13.10.1977 while the property had already been\\nrelinquished by his father, respondent No.3 by virtue of registered relinquishment deed\\non 30.3.1972, i.e. before his birth. It has further been pleaded that the appellant has no\\ncause of action to challenge the relinquishment deed executed in favour of respondent\\nNo.1.\\nThe appellant filed his reply to the said application on 14.3.1997 and pleaded that\\nprovision of Order 7 Rule 11 of C.P.C. was not applicable in view of cause of action\\nmentioned in the plaint and the disputed questions could be decided only after recording\\nthe evidence of both the parties and prayed for dismissal of this application.\\nOn consideration of above said circumstances, the trial Court arrived at the\\nconclusion that in view of the above said relinquishment deed plaintiff being the son of\\nrespondent No.3 had no right to challenge the same and claim the suit property and\\naccordingly the application was allowed suit of the plaintiff/appellant was dismissed.\\nHence the appellant has knocked at the door of this Court in the present appeal.\\nWe have given ample opportunity to the learned counsel of both the parties to\\nadvance their contentions. On hearing them we are of the considered view that this\\nappeal has no merit and deserves to be dismissed.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that being a coparcener he has a share in\\nthe inherited property and this right could not be destroyed by his father respondent No.3even before his birth. He also submitted that it is an undisputed fact that the property was\\nancestral and came into the Branch of his grand father Late Shikhar Chand Jain in family\\narrangement/ partition and, thereafter, same was not partitioned in between the\\nrespondent No.1 and other respondents or among coparcener of the family and if any\\ndocument regarding relinquishment was signed by respondent No.3 and other\\nrespondents in favour of respondent No.1 was not valid and in other words was ab-initio\\nnull and void. He further submitted that relinquishment deed was executed by respondent\\nNo.2 to 5 in favour of their mother respondent No.1 on 30.3.1972, till then appellant was\\nnot born, therefore, the said document of relinquishement is not binding against him and\\nas a coparcener he has a right in the property and could not be deprived of it even on the\\nground of his birth subsequent to said document. He further submitted that according to\\nHindu law a coparcener acquired right by birth and before his birth any documentation\\nagainst his right had taken place then same could be challenged by him after his birth and\\non attaining majority and such dispute could have been decided only after recording of\\nevidence whether the said document was null and void. He also submitted that before\\nfiling of the wirtten statement and framing the issues or in any case without recording the\\nevidence on merit the trial court had no jurisdiction to dismiss the suit under order 7 Rule\\n11 of C.P.C. at the initial stage and according to his submission in the peculiar facts and\\ncircumstances of the case evidence was required and in the lack of it case was decided\\nthen the impugned order deserves to be set aside and case be remitted back to the trial\\nCourt for adjudication on merits after recording the evidence.\\nIn support of his contention he has placed reliance on two decisions of this Court\\n(i) Shiv Ratan v. Kanhaiyalal & others1 and (ii) Kalawati (Mst) v. Dhaniya Bai2.\\nAccording to his submission in both the case it has been laid that where case requires\\ntendering of evidence the suit cannot be dismissed under Order 7 Rule 11 of C.P.C. at\\nthe initial stage.\\nIn response to aforesaid contension the learned counsel for the respondents\\nvehemently argued that although the property was belonging to his forefathers but the\\nshare of the respondent No.3 being a coparcener of the family and Karta of his Branch\\nrelinquished by said relinquishment deed on 30.3.1972 much prior to birth of the\\nplaintiff and whatever transaction took place in between respondents that is binding on\\nthe appellant being a son of respondent No.3. In support of his contention he referred\\nsome pleadings of the plaint and submitted that it is not in dispute that the appellant was\\nborn on 13.10.1977 and the deed of relinquishment was executed long before his birth\\ni.e. on 30.3.1972 and whatever transaction had already taken place and property was\\ndevolved or vested in the name of respondent No.1 only and said transaction was never\\nchallenged by respondent No.3 then it was binding even against appellant by virtue of\\nprinciples of estoppel as enumerated under Section 115 of Evidence Act. He further\\nsubmitted that exucution of relinquishment deed was not admitted by the appellant but\\nrespondent No.3 has so stated in his written statement and it is apparent that the said deed\\nwas never cancelled by either of the parties and also otherwise such document was never\\nchallenged by respondent No.3 till today.\\nHe further submitted that according to provisions of Hindu Undivided (Joint)\\nFamily in the life time of Karta son has no authority to file the suit or proceedings\\nagainst his grand father or grand mother and lastly he submitted that the trial Court hasconsidered all possible aspects by passing an elaborate order regarding dismissal of suit\\nwhich does not require any interference in this appeal. He aslo placed reliance on the\\ndecision rendered in the Case of Mandli Prasad v. Ramcharan lal and others1, in which\\nit was held as follows :\\n''64. The view taken by the Madras High Court in Karishma Swami v.\\nPulukarappa2 , Ranga Thathachariar v. Shrinavasa Thathachariar3, Rangasayi\\nv. Nagarathmamma4 and followed by the Bombay High Court in Ramsingh v.\\nFakira is not only the more logical view but it is also the better one from the\\npoint of view of convenience; it safeguards the interest of the minor avoids\\nanomalies and makes for consistency. We approve these decisions and hold that\\neven in a suit filed by a minor the severance of status takes place from the date\\nof the suit and not from the dated of the decree. Accordingly the critical date was\\nthe 27th September 1937 when civil suit No.6-A of 1937 for partition was filed\\nby Dineshchandra. As on that date Mandli Prasad was not in utero, he was not\\nentitled to reopen the partition made that suit. Ram Charan Lal was given a share\\nand the plaintiff was entitled under law to claim a portion out of his share and\\nnot out of the share given to Devi Prasad.''\\nHe has also placed reliance on Chandra Kanta v. Ashok Kumar5 in which it has\\nbeen held as follows :\\n''5. The Supreme Court has considered the impact of Hindu Succession Act 1956\\nin it its judgment in the Case of Commissioner of Wealth-tax, Kanpur etc v.\\nChander Sen etc.6 and held as under :\\n19. It is necessary to bear in mind the Preamble to the Hindu Succession Act.\\n1956. The Preamble states that it was an Act to amend and codify the law relating\\nto intestate succession among Hindus.\\n20. In view of Preamble to the Act i.e. that to modify where necessary and to\\ncodify the law, in our opinion it is not possible when Schedule indicates heirs in\\nClass I and only includes son and does not include sons son but does include son\\nof a predeceased son, to say that when son inherits the property in the situation\\ncontemplated by section 8 he takes it as Karta of his own undivided family. The\\nGujrat High Court's view noted above, if accepted, would mean that though the\\nson of a predeceased son and not the son of a son who is intended to be\\nexcluded under Section 8 to inherit, the latter would be applying the old Hindu\\nlaw get a right by birth of the said property contrary to the scheme outlined in\\nSection 8.''\\nThe Supreme Court in it judgment in the case of Yudhishter v. Ashok Kumar1, has\\nagain considered the question and has held as under :\\n10. This question has been considered by this Court in Commissioner of Wealth\\nTax, Kanpur v. Chander Sen2, where one of us (Sabysachi Mukharji J) observed\\nthat under the Hindu Law, the moment a son is born, he gets a share in fathers's\\nproperty and becomes part of the coparcenary. His right accrues to him not the\\ndeath of the father or inheritance from the father but with the very fact of his\\nbirth Normally, therefore, whenever the father gets a property from whatever\\nsource from the grandfather or from any other source, be it separate property or\\nnot, his son should have a share in that and it will become part of the joint Hindu\\nfamily with him. This Court observed that this position has been affected bySection 8 of the Hindu Succession Act 1956 and, therefore, after the Act, when\\nthe son inherited the property in the situation contemplated by Section 8, he does\\nnot take it as Kar of his own undivided family but takes it in his individual\\ncapacity.''\\nIn view of aforesaid dictum of the Apex Court he submitted that if the property was\\ninherited by respondent No.3, then although it was a property of undivided Hindu family\\nbut under the provision of Section 8 of Hindu Succession Act after demise of Shri\\nShikhar Chand Jain, whatever share of respondent No.3 was in existence had become his\\nself acquired share and same was relinquished and thereafter being a son the appellant\\nhas not authority to challenge the same and it is undisputed that it was not challenged by\\nthe respondent No.3.\\nIn view of aforesaid submission, we would proceed to examine the entire factual\\nmatrix of the case. It is apparent that initially this property was purchased by Late Lal\\nChand Jain on 8.1.1937 and the same was given by way of family arrangement or in\\npartition to Late Shikhar Chand Jain and after his demise the property was inherited by\\nrespondent No.1 to 5 as his legal representatives and by virtue of Section 8 of Hindu\\nSuccession Act they had become co-owner of the property. In view of the foresaid\\ndictum of the Apex Court they are not coparcener but co-owner of the property and\\nbeing a co-owner respondent No.3 by executing relinquish deed had given his share to his\\nmother, respondent No.1 and after this transaction appellant was born on 13.10.1977.\\nWhen the appellant was not in existence and any transaction took place regarding the\\nproperty in between the interesse respondent then it could not be challenged at the\\nsubsequent stage. According to aforesaid discussion appellant was not having any cause\\nof action or authority to file the suit against the respondent.\\nWhile dealing with Order 7 Rule 11 of the C.P.C. the Apex Court has given\\nfollowing verdict in the matter of T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal and another1:\\n''5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the petitioner for the gross\\nabuse of the process of the Court repeatedly land unrepententlyh resorted to.\\nFrom the statement of the facts found in the judgment of the High Court, it is\\nperfectly plain that the suit now pending before the First Munsif's Court\\nBangalore, is a flagrant misuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints.\\nThe learned Munsif must remember that if on a meaningful-not formal-reading of\\nthe plaint it is manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing\\nas clear right to sue, he should exercise his power under O. VII R. 11, C.P.C.\\ntaking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clear\\ndrafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first\\nhearing by examining the party searchingly under O.X. C.P.C. An activist Judge\\nis the answer to irresponsible law suits. The trial Courts would insist imperatively\\non examining the party at the first hearing so that bogus litigation can be shot\\ndown at the earliest stage. The Penal Code is also resourceful enough to meet\\nsuch men, (Ch. XI) and must be triggered against them. In this case, the learned\\nJudge to his cost realised what George Bernard Shaw remarked on the\\nassasination of Mahatma Gandhi.\\n''It is dangerous to be too good.''6. The trial Court in this case will remind itself of S. 35-A, C.P.C. and take\\ndeterrent action if it is satisfied that the litigation was inspired by vexatious\\nmotives and altogether groundless. In any view, that suit has no survival value\\nand should be disposed of forthwith after giving an immediate hearing to the\\nparties concerned.''\\nIn view of aforesaid dictum of Apex Court the suit of the appellant/plaintiff was\\nnot tenable and therefore, trial Court has not committed any error of jurisdiction or\\nperversity in dismissing the suit of appellant under Order 7 Rule 11 of C.P.C. Thus, this\\nappeal has no merit and the same is dismissed but in the facts and circumstances of the\\nCase there shall be no Order as to cost.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n---------\",\n",
              " \"CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 437/1994\\n-----------\\nOpinion of third Judge\\nBefore Mr. Justice S.L. Kochar.\\n14 November, 2005.\\nJUZAR SINGH S/o BAHADURSINGH RAJPUT ...Appellant*\\nv.\\nSTATE OF MADHYA PRADESH ...Respondent\\nJai Singh with D. Yadav, for the appellants.\\nG. Desai, Dy. A.G. for the State.\\nCur. adv. vult.\\nJUDGMENT\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\\nR.D. VYAS, J:–\\n2. This appeal arises against the judgment and order dated 22.6.1994 in S.T.No. 78/93\\npassed by the IInd Additional Sessions Judge, Ujjain, who was pleased to convict the appellant\\nof offences u/ss 302, 201 and 176 of the Indian Penal Code.\\n3. The short facts giving rise to this appeal are that the appellant Juzarsingh had married the\\ndeceased Kailash Kunwar Bai 8-10 years before the death of the deceased Kailash Kunwar Bai.\\nP.W.-6 Krushnabai aged 7 years at the time of her deposition was the only daughtar who was\\ngiven birth during that wed-lock. PW-5 Nathhusingh gave a written report to the Police Station\\nKhachrod on 9.5.1992, which is at Ex.P-2, shows that after the marriage the appellant Juzarsingh\\nhis brothers Ganpatsingh, Kamalsingh, Arjunsingh, Ramsingh and mother Ramkunwarbai as also\\nfather Bahadursingh and the wife of Ganpatsingh (the brother of the appellant) as also the wife\\nof Kamalsingh (the brother of the appellant) as also the wife of Arjunsingh used to harrass the\\ndeceased demanding dowry or for that matter bringing less dowry. She was not supplied food\\nand the deceased was being beaten, she was pushed out of the marital home time and again. The\\nmother of the appellant Rajkunwarbai is said to have said Juzarsingh should marry again as the\\ndeceased did not give birth to any son. In short it is said ultimately in that complaint that the\\ndeceased was killed in the night between 6th and 7th of May, 1992 and was burnt away. The\\ninformation of the death was not given to the father of the deceased. Upon this, after\\ninvestigation the appellant was tried and convicted, as aforesaid.\\n4. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the only evidence brought in by the\\nprosecution is of Krushnabai, the daughter of the appellant and the deceased aged 7 years only,\\nwhich should not be relied upon. He contended that the evidence suggests that the deceased was\\nnot keeping well and had lost the balance of mind and was treated for the same, therefore, the\\nlower court ought to have presumed that the deceased had a natural death. He submitted since the\\nprosecution evidence does not support the evidence of PW-6 Krushnabai, a minor witness, the\\norder of conviction and sentence deserves to be set aside. The learned Public Prosecutor\\nsupported the judgment.\\n5. Considering the evidence of PW-6 Krushnabai it comes out that the appellant kicked the\\ndeceased and throttled her no doubt the timings given by this witness are not exact, in the first\\nplace she had said that the mother of this witness (deceased) died at about 2 O'clock whereas\\nlater on she replied to a querry from the court that her father came at about 4 O'Clock and,\\ntherefore, the time of death should be taken to be 4 O'clock and not earlier. Except this small\\ndiscrepancy of timing of the night, the rest of the evidence of this witness has not been\\nchallenged except by suggesting that she was tutored by the grand-father.\\n6. It must also be borne in mind that there was a dispute between the spouse and a notice\\nwas sent by the deceased to the appellant in the year 1990, which shows the marital life between\\nthe two was not happy. The death takes place on the night where the family was to celiberate the\\nmarriage of the brother of the appellant. The deceased was either burnt away or cremated\\nimmediately after the death and the father of the deceased was informed on the next day. These\\ncircumstances, if borne in mind, the conduct of the appellant is not only doubtful but dubious\\nsince the appellant has not explained the circumstances under which the deceased was cremated.\\nThat circumstance must be borne in mind while appreciating the evidence of the daughter of the\\nappellant himself, who is of tender age and who stated that her father the appellant kicked themother and pressed the throat of the deceased. She clearly stated that the mother died on the\\npressing of the throat. Since no other eivdence is brought in or permitted to be brought in by the\\nappellant, she has to give the court any idea about any injury or otherwise or the death being\\nnatural. There is no reason why the evidence of his own daughter should be discarded. The\\ncircumstances after the death particularly the conduct of the appellant does not permit us to\\npresume anything in favour of the appellant. In such circumstances, the appeal deserves to be\\ndismissed and is dismissed. The bailbonds of the appellant are cancelled. He is directed to\\nsurrender failing which the Authorities should take steps according to law.\\n7. At this stage as there is difference of opinion, the matter is directed to be referred\\naccording to law after obtaining appropriate orders from Hon'ble the Chief Justice.\\nPer Shambhoo Singh, J.\\n1. I went through the judgment prepared by my learned brother. With respect I differ from\\nthe view taken by him.\\n2. The facts of the case, as mentioned by my learned brother are that the appellant was\\nmarried to the deceased Kailashkunwar 8-10 years back. He had one daughter Krishnabai\\n(P.W.6) aged about 6 years. He was living alongwith the deceased and his daughter Krishnabai,\\nwith his father Bahadursingh, brothers Ganpatsingh, Arjunsingh and mother Rajkunwarbai in the\\nsame house in village Lasudiya Khema. Prosecution case is that the appellant used to harass\\nKailashkunwar by demanding dowry, she was not even supplied food and was beaten. In the\\nintrvening night of 6th and 7th May, 1992 the deceased was sleeping in her room situated on\\nfirst story of the house alongwith her daughter Krishnabai, aged about 6 years. The appellant\\nwent to his room and killed the deceased Kailashkunwar by throttling and by giving kicks in her\\nabdomen and burnt her alive. The appellant did not inform the death of his wife to her parents\\nand cremated her body. On 9.5.92. Nathusingh (P.W.5), the father of the deceased, lodged\\nwritten FIR Ex. P.2 at P.S. Khachrod. After investigation, challan was filed. The appellant\\npleaded not guilty. His defence was that Kailash Kunwarbai was suffering from mental disease\\nand she died natural death. Dr. Rajesh Sanghvi (D.W.1), mental hospital, Indore, was examined\\nin defence. pay fine of Rs. 1,000/-, in default of payment to undergo further one month's\\nimprisonment and u/s 201 IPC 3 years RI and u/s 176 IPC, one month RI.\\n3. Shri Jaisingh, LC for the appellant submitted that the learned trial Judge committed error\\nin convicting the appellant on the solitary testimony of Krishnabai, daughter of the appellant,\\nwho was aged about 6 years and was living with the parents of the deceased. She was tutored\\nand her evidence was full of omissions & contradictions. He further submitted that the\\nprosecution did not examine Badrilal and Prabhusingh who had seen the dead-body of\\nKailashkunwar before cremation. They did not find any injury on the dead-body. On the other\\nhand, Shri P. Verma, learned Dy. G.A. supported the impugned judgment.\\n4. No doubt, a child is a competent witness and conviction could be based on his/her\\ntestimony provided the witness was telling the truth and was not tutored. Child witness can be\\ntutored easily, therefore, his evidence should be examined with care and caution, specially in this\\ncase, as Krishnabai was living with the parents of the deceased and had come to Court to give\\nevidence with them. Krishnabai stated that on the date of incident, she was sleeping with her\\nmother Kailashkunwar in her room. The appellant came from out side. He gave kicks on the\\nabdomen of her mother and pressed her throat. She did not state that on pressing the throat,\\nKailashkunwar became unconscious or died. She stated that she had seen the watch, it was 4 a.m.\\nbut when the trial Judge asked her to see the watch and tell what was the time, she saw the watch\\nbut could not tell time. It is, thus, clear that she was not knowing how to see time in a watch,\\nunder such circumstances, the argument of Shri Jaisingh, LC for the appellant, that this witness\\nwas living with the parents of the deceased and they tutored her, cannot be said to be without\\nsubstance. He contended that a child of six years would not be awaking whole night without any\\nreason, this fact is itself sufficient to show that she was tutored by the parents of the deceased. It\\nis true that initially there was no cordial relation between these two families. Nathushingh\\n(P.W.5) father of the deceased, deposed that the appellant used to harass the deceased, he was\\ndemanding dowry. He stated that the appellant asked for Rs. 4000-5000/-. Ishwarsingh (P.W.1)\\nand Bhagwansingh (P.W.2), brothers of the deceased, stated that the appellant used to harass\\nKailashkunwar. He even did not supply food to her and beat her. But they admitted in cross-\\nexamination that the deceased did not mention this fact to them she stated these facts to\\nGovindkunwar (P.W.2), wife of Bhagwansingh but she did not support the statements of her\\nhusband Bhagwansingh and Ishwarsingh. She stated that the appellant used to treatKailashkunwar in a normal way. His behaviour was good with her. She stated that quarrel used to\\ntake place between them as is usual in families. The statement of Govindkunwar makes it clear\\nthat Kailashkunwar did not make any complaint about misbehaviour or ill treatment. It is true\\nthat Anoopsingh (P.W.4) who was the resident of Dewas where the parents of the deceased\\nreside deposed that the deceased used to tell her that the appellant harassed her and told him that\\nhe was not even giving her food, but he admitted in cross-examination that he did not disclose\\nthis fact to any one except Nathusingh. But Nathusingh did not say so. He went to the extent of\\nstating that he saw injuries on her head and cheek. This fact does not find place in his police\\nstatement Ex. D/3. It clearly shows that he has improved his statement and cannot be believed.\\nNathusingh, father of the deceased, Ishwarsingh and Bhagwansingh, the brothers of\\nGovindkunwarbai, the sister-in-law, did not state that the deceased told them that the appellant\\nhad beaten her and they saw injuries on her head and cheek.\\n6. The statement of Krishnabai that the appellant pressed her mother's throat is false. The\\nappellant only gave kicks to the deceased. It appears that she has been tutored to state that the\\nappellant pressed her mother's throat. If pressure was applied by the appellant on\\nKailashkunwar's throat, she must have felt suffocation and must have struggled for life, must\\nhave shouted or atleast made some noise as her mouth was not gagged. Krishnabai did not state\\nthat Kailashkunwar made some noise or raised her hands or feet or struggled or she became\\nunconcious or died. The dead-body of Kailashkunwar was cremated in presence of the residents\\nof the village. Shri Jaisingh submitted that the investigating officer examined three witnesses\\nwho inspected the dead-body of Kailashkunwar before cremation and they found no injury or\\nsign of struggle on her body.\\n7. Shri Jaisingh, LC, submitted that Kailashkunwar was suffering from manic depressive\\npsychosis and she died of this disease. Dr. Rajesh Sanghvi (D.W.1) deposed that Kailashkunwar\\nwas suffering from manic depressive psychosis. He produced the record of her treatment of\\nmental hospital, Indore, Ex. D.9 and D.10 and stated that if the patient goes under deep\\ndepression or mania death was probable. Goverdhanshingh (P.W.4) whose house is situate in\\nfront of the appellant, stated that Kailashkunwar was insane, she used to tear her clothes and\\nsometimes became naked and used to throw stones on the persons going on the way. From the\\nevidence of Goverdhansingh and Dr. Rajesh Sanghvi (D.W.1) it is clear that the deceased was\\nsuffering from manic depressive psychosis and the possibllity of dying from this disease as\\nopined by Dr. Sanghvi, cannot be ruled out.\\n8. For convicting an accused for commiting the offence of culpable homicide, it must be\\nproved that he caused the death by doing an act with the intention of causing death or with\\nintention of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause death or with the knowledge that he\\nwas likely by such act to cause death. In this case, the prosecution failed to prove beyond\\nreasonable doubt that the appellant with intention to kill his wife Kailashkunwar, caused her such\\ninjury which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. There is no evidence\\nthat Kailashkunwar died due to kicks given by the appellant. There is no evidence that\\nKailashkunwar was labouring under such a disease that kicks on abdomen was likely to cause\\ndeath. Under such circumstances, the learned trial Judge committed error in convicting the\\nappellant for offence u/s 302 of the IPC. It has also not been proved that the appellant cremated\\nthe dead-body of Kailashkunwar. It has come in the evidence that Nathusingh, the father of the\\nappellant, cremated the dead-body in presence of the villagers. Therefore, no offence u/s 201\\nIPC has been proved against the appellant. The appellant also cannot be convicted for offence u/s\\n176 of the IPC for not giving information of the death of Kailashkunwar. As it has not been\\nproved that Kailashkunwarbai was killed, only offence u/s 323 IPC has been proved, therefore, in\\nview of Section 39 of the Cr.P.C. the appellant was not bound to give information of the death\\nof Kailashkunwar, therefore, offence u/s 176 of the IPC, was also not proved. The learned trial\\nJudge fell in error in convicting the appellant for offences u/ss 201 and 176 IPC.\\n9. However, as stated above, it has been proved that the appellant gave kicks to the deceased\\nvoluntarily and thereby committed an offence punishable u/s 323 IPC. After hearing on sentence,\\nhe is sentenced to one year R.I. and to pay fine of Rs. 1,000/-, in default of payment of fine,\\nthree months further RI.\\n10. Thus, the appeal stands partly allowed. The appellant is acquitted of the offences u/ss.\\n302, 201 and 176 IPC and instead he is convicted & sentenced for offence u/s 323 IPC as stated\\nabove. He is on bail, his bailbonds are cancelled. He shall surrender before the trial Court for\\nserving out the jail-sentence. The trial Court shall secure his presence and take him into custody\\nand send him to jail.OPINION\\nOn difference of opinion between the then Justice Shri R.D. Vyas and the then Justice Shri\\nShambhoo Singh, this matter is placed before me as per provision under Section 392 of the Code\\nof Criminal Procedure.\\n2. I have gone through both the conflicting judgments passed by the then Justice Shri R.D.\\nVyas and the then Justice Shri Shambhoo Singh in the aforesaid Criminal Appeal and I am in full\\nagreement with the judgment passed by Justice Shri R.D. Vyas dismissing the appeal of the\\nappellant, but, in view of the pronouncement contained in the case of State of Andhra Pradesh\\nv. P.T. Appiah [AIR 1980 S.C. 365], Mattai v. State of U.P. [(2002) 6 S.C.C. 460] and Sajjan\\nSingh and others v. State of M.P. [(1999) I SCC 315]. I am required to give my independant\\nopinion considering the rival contentions of the parties.\\n3. The facts giving rise to this reference are that the father of deceased Kailash Kunwar,\\nnamely Nathusingh (PW-5) gave a written report (Ex.P/2) at the Police Station to the effect that\\nthe appellant Jhujharsingh was married with Kailash Kunwar eight to ten years prior to her death\\nin the intervening night of 6th and 7th May, 1992. PW-6 Krishna Bai was the only daughter out\\nof their wedlock. It is alleged that Kailash Kunwar was not being supplied proper and sufficient\\nfood and she was driven out from the marital home time and again. The mother of the appellant\\nused to say that she had not given birth to a male child, therefore, the appellant should enter into\\nsecond marriage. The in-laws were levelling allegations against Kailash Kunwar in regard to her\\ncharacter and were ill-treating her for demand of dowry or bringing less dowry. Kailash Kunwar\\nfrom time to time used to disclose all these facts to her parents, brother and sister-in-law. At\\ntimes she was pacified by the complainant Nathusingh (PW-5) saying that some time wisdom\\nmay prevail to the appellant and that it was her own house. Bearing in mind these teachings, she\\ncontinued to live with her husband. In the year 1990 of the appellant with a pre-plan tried to\\nenter into second marriage and getting knowledge of this fact a legal notice (Ex.P/3) was sent to\\nthe appellant through Advocate. Therefore, on intervention by community members, the\\nappellant took Kailash Kunwar with him. Despite ill-treatment and harassment, she was residing\\nwith the appellant.\\n4. There was a marriage function of Kamalsingh (Family member) at the house of\\nappellant wherein the complainant Nathusingh (PW-5) did not participate because he was not\\ninvited and the appellant and his family members, after hetching conspiracy, killed his daughter\\n(deceased Kailash Kunwar) and also cremated her dead body without any information to him.\\nGanpatsingh, elder brother of the appellant came and informed him that because of quarrel and\\nbeating Kailash Kunwar sustained injury and thereafter she was ablazed. Ganpatsingh asked him\\nnot to take any action against the appellant and his family members. He also asked him to\\nexecute an affidavit in their favour otherwise he would be implicated. On receiving this\\ninformation, he went at Khachrod and gathered information, thereafter submitted a written\\nreport. According to this report, the deceased was not suffering from any disease. She was beaten\\non 06.05.92 and her dead body was cremated without any intimation to him and his family\\nmembers, so that any action may not be taken against the appellant and his family members. The\\ncomplainant also sought custody of his grand-daughter PW-6 Krishnabai.\\n5. On the same day, crime was registered vide Cr. No. 216/92 under Section 302/201/176\\nIndian Penal Code against the appellant and after due investigation, charge-sheet was filed\\nagainst the appellant. The appellant denied the charges and pleaded innocence. He stated that the\\ndeceased Kailash Kunwar met a natural death. He examined one witness DW-1 Dr. Rajesh in his\\ndefence. To prove its case, the prosecution examined eight witnesses. Learned Trial Court, after\\nconsidering the evidence adduced by the parties and hearing, convicted the appellant for the\\noffences charged and sentenced him to undergo improsonment for life with fine of Rs. 100/-, in\\ndefault of payment of fine to suffer additional imprisonment for one month, three years and one\\nmonth respectively.\\n6. Getting dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment of conviction and sentence, the appellant\\npreferred the aforesaid Criminal Apeal before this High Court. Learned Justice Shri R.D. Vyas\\nwas of the opinion that the conduct of the appellant was not only doubtful, but, was also\\ndubious as he did not explain the circumstances in which the dead body was cremated and\\nrelying on the evidence of eye-witness PW-6, Krishna bai, who was of tender age, affirmed the\\nconviction and sentence of the appellant. At the same time, learned Shri Justice Shambhoo was\\nof the view that for holding the appellant guilty of the offence of culpable homicide, it must be\\nproved that he caused death by doing an act with the intention of causing death or with intent ofcausing such bodily injury as was likely to cause death or with knowledge that it was likely by\\nsuch act to cause death and the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the\\nappellant caused such bodily injury which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\\ncause death of Kailash Kunwar and that there was no evidence that the deceased was labouring\\nunder such a disease that kicks on abdomen was likely to cause her death. On this ground, he\\nopined that the conviction under Section 302 IPC was not proper. The dead body was cremated\\nin the presence of villagers, therefore, the offence under Section 201 IPC was also not made out.\\nHe was also of the view that the appellant could not be convicted for the offence under Section\\n176. However, relying on the testimony of child-witness PW-6 Krishnabai, daughter of\\nappellant, he opined that the appellant committed an offence under Section 323 IPC for having\\ncaused simple hurt to the deceased. He, therefore, convicted the appellant u/s 323 IPC and\\nsentenced him to suffer R.I. for one year and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- and in default of\\npayment of fine, to suffer additional R.I. for three months.\\n7. Learned Sr. counsel Shri Jaisingh appearing for the appellant, submitted that the\\nstatement of child-witness PW-6 Krishnabai is not worth placing reliance because of material\\nomissions, improvements and contradictions. She was residing with the parents of the deceased\\nand, therefore, possibility of tutoring by them is not ruled out and that the prosecution has failed\\nto adduce cogent and reliable evidence for motive of the appellant for committing murder of his\\nwife. According to him, cremation of dead body was done by the father of the appellant.\\nTherefore, he could not be held responsible for offence under Section 201 and 176 IPC. He also\\nsubmitted that the prosecution has not examined witnesses Badrilal and Prabhusingh who had\\nseen the dead body of Kailash Kunwarbai before cremation and did not find any mark of\\nviolence and that the deceased met a natural death because of attack of manic deppressive\\npsychosis as opined by the defence witness DW-1 Dr. Rajesh Sanghvi. Learned counsel\\nvehemently supported the judgment and finding arrived at by the learned brother Justice Shri\\nShambhoo Singh.\\n8. On the other hand, learned Dy. Govt. Advocate Shri S.D. Vohra has submitted that there\\nis over-whelming evidence available on record regarding ill-treatment and torture to the deceased\\nby the appellant. The appellant wanted to get rid of her and to enter into a second marriage. On\\nthis issue, there were exchange of legal notices between the appellant and the deceased Kailash\\nKunwar. On all these issues, legal notice by Regd. Post A.D. was sent through her Advocate vide\\nEx.P/3. Postal receipt is Ex.P/4 and P/5 a letter sent to the post Master regarding service of\\nnotice and not receiving the acknowledgment due was submitted. Learned Prosecutor has\\nsubmitted that daughter of appellant PW-6 Krishnabai has given natural and true statement and\\nthere is no reason to disbelieve her statement and if the deceased met a natural death, why her\\nparents were not informed and waited for their arrival and participation in her funeral. Because\\nof demand of dowry and cruel behaviour by the appellant with his deceased wife she had some\\ndippression and for which the appellant was responsible and if she was suffering from any\\nmental ailment or disorder that could also be a motive for the appellant to kill her and thereafter,\\nenter into second marriage. The appellant and his family members were also dissatisfied because\\nof not having male issue. After a period of nine years of their marriage, the appellant and the\\ndeceased produced the only female child Krishnabai (PW-6) aged six years. The learned PP has\\nstrongly supported the judgment and finding passed by the learned trial Court as well as the\\njudgment passed by Justice Shri R.D. Vyas.\\n9. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after careful perusal of the oral and\\ndocumentary evidence adduced and produced by the parties, it emerged that the deceased\\nKailash Kunwarbai was being ill-treated by the appellant and she was disclosing about beating\\nand not providing food by the appellant to her brother Ishwarsingh, Bhagwansingh and sister-in-\\nlaw Govind Kunwar Bai.\\n10. PW-1 Ishwar Singh has deposed that his sister, deceased Kailash Kunwarbai was married\\nwith appellant before ten years and they were having one daughter named Krishnabai. The\\nappellant was beating her and also was not providing food. He came to know this fact when the\\ndeceased disclosed it before PW-3 Govind Kunwarbai i.e. sister-in-law of this witness (wife of\\nhis brother). This witness has further stated that before him also, the deceased disclosed about ill-\\ntreatment by her husband and he told this fact to his father, upon which, his father went to the\\nhouse of appellant Jujharsingh. In cross-examination, he admitted about sickness of his sister\\nKailash Kunwar, but he denied her sickness prior to her marriage. He also stated in cross-\\nexamination that he was informed by Krishnabai about pressing of neck of the deceased by the\\nappellant and inflicting kick-blows. He could not give the date, month and year in which thedeceased disclosed about ill-treatment to him as well as to his sister-in-law Govind Kunwarbai.\\nHe also deposed about getting the deceased treated by her father.\\n11. On independant assessment of the evidence of this witness, he stood firm on the question\\nof ill-treatment, beating, not providing of food and threatening the deceased by the appellant\\nand disclosure of all these events by the deceased.\\n12. PW-2 Bhagwansingh is another brother of deceased. He also stated about marriage of\\nthe deceased before 8-10 years. According to this witness, deceased was complaining about\\nbeating and ill-treatment to her by the appellant, to his wife Govind Kunwarbai and Govind\\nKunwar Bai in her turn informed all these facts to this witness, and this fact was also informed to\\nhis father who admonished the appellant. In cross-examination, he say is that the deceased fell\\nsick after marriage before 4/5 years from her death and he was not knowing what kind of\\nailment was she having. He further deposed that he asked the deceased Kailash Kunwarbai about\\nher sickness who told him about hungriness, not providing food in time and she was got treated\\nby her father. Now in the statement of this witness also, I find sufficient material about fact that\\nthe deceased was being ill-treated by the appellant and she was not getting proper food in her\\nmatrimonial house. She fell sick because of non-supply of food and for want of good behaviour.\\n13. PW-3 Govind Kunwar Bai is the sister-in -law of the deceased, wife of PW-2–\\nBhagwansingh. She has not specifically stated about disclosure of ill-treatment, beating and\\ncruel behaviour given by the appellant, but she has stated that some sort of dispute was going on\\nbetween them and she was complaining about the same. She has also deposed that the deceased\\nwas being kept properly but, she was sick and again voluntarily disclosed that some sort of\\nquarrel was happening and deceased was having talks with her brother and her father also. In\\ncross-examination, she has stated that the deceased fell sick after marriage. Prior to that she was\\nnot sick and she was not knowing about her ailment. Again in cross-examination para 7, she\\nexpressed her ignorance about good relations between the spouse.\\n14. On going through the statement of this witness, it appears that the deceased was\\ndisclosing her about quarrel and dispute with her husband and in her matrimonial house. But, this\\nwitness took all that as usual event.\\n15. The Fourth witness pw-4 Govindsingh examined by the prosecution has turned hostile.\\nHe is the resident of village laudia where the appellant was residing. In his examination-in-\\nChief, he has stated that the deceasd was mad and he was not knowing about her sickness prior\\nto her marriage. In cross-examination, he admitted that according to the village-relation, he is\\nbrother of the appellant. He was confronted with his case-diary statement Ex. D/1 and he has\\ndenied his entire case-diary statement. He has further deposed about madness of the deceased\\nand her-unusual behaviour of throwing stones at the villagers and tearing of clothes. On cross-\\nexamination by the defence advocate, he has stated that right from the time of marriage, she was\\nsick and she was mad as well as having manic attacks. On assessment of the entire statement of\\nthis witness Govindsingh, it can easily be discern that he is not giving true version about the\\nsickness of the deceased and gave contradictory sratement in his examination-in-chief and\\nthereafter in cross-examination about sickness of the deceased prior to and after her marriage.\\n16. PW-5 Nathusingh is the father of deceased. He has testified that after the death of his\\ndaughter, Ganpat singh, the elder brother of appellant, came to Dewas and asked him to take\\nseven to eight thousand rupees for not lodging report because his brother ( the appellant ) had\\nkilled his daughter ( Kailash Kunwar ). Ganpat Singh also disclosed that the appellant killed his\\nwife by pressing the neck (throttling). Thereafter, he reached with Shankar singh at Lasudiya\\nKhema where Krishnabai, the daughter of deceased told him about throttling of deceased by the\\nappellant. After knowing this fact, he went to Police Station and lodged the report Ex. P/7 and\\nalso submitted an application before Khachrod Court for custody of Krishnabai, daughter of\\ndeceased and the custody of Krishnabai was given to him as per Court's order . This witness\\nfurther testified that after marriage, the deceased was ill-treated by the appellant for demand of\\ndowry. He was not providing food to Kailash Kunwar and used to assault her. When-ever the\\ndeceased was visiting his house, she used to disclose all these facts to her brother Bhagwansingh\\n(PW-2). Bhagwansingh PW-2, in his cross-examination para 4 stated that when he asked the\\ndeceased about her sickness, she disclosed about hungriness and not providing food to her in\\ntime by the appellant. When this witness tried to admonish her she getting shy and started\\nweeping. He also stated about sending of notice Ex. P/3 and proved the same in Court with\\npostal receipt Ex. P/4 and the letter of inquiry from postal authority (Ex. P/5). This witness also\\nhad admonished the appellant jujharsingh for cruel behaviour with the deceased kailash Kunwarand demand of dowry. According to him, prior to marriage the deceased was hale and hearty.\\nAfter marriage also she did not become mad but, she was being beaten and also being ill-treated\\nby the appellant. In cross-examination, he admitted that the fact of demand of dowry by the\\nappellant was not disclosed by him to any body.\\n17. In the notice (Ex. P/3), the fact of payment of four/five thousand rupees was not\\nmentioned, but the fact of demand of dowry as well as ill-treatment was mentioned. On going\\nthrough the contents of the notice (Ex. P/3), all these facts are found mentioned in the notice\\nalongwith the fact that the appellant was going to enter into second marriage, for which he was\\nwarned. This notice was dated 14.02.90. At that time, the deceased was in the house of this\\nwitness. This notice is also containing the fact of mental disorder of deceased becaused of ill-\\ntreatment and cruel behaviour extended by the appellant. Ex.P/4 is the postal receipt showing the\\nfact of sending the registered A.D. letter to the appellant and Ex.P/5 is the letter written to the\\nPost Master, Dewas Post Office by Advocate of the deceased Kailashkunwar about verification\\nof service of registered envelope to the appellant and not receiving the acknowledgment due for\\nthe same.\\n18. It is pertinent to mention here that in the accused statement recorded under Section 313\\nCr.P.C., the appellant in answer to question No.10 expressed his ignorance and he has not\\nspecifically denied about receipt of such notice.\\n19. In para 13 of his cross-examination, the say of this witness is that deceased died on 6th,\\nher funeral was performed on 7th, Ganpat, the elder brother of appellant came to him at Dewas\\non 8th. At the time of talk with Ganpat, no body was present and he did not disclose the fact of\\noffer of seven to eight thousand rupees, to his family members. In para 15, he further stated\\nabout sending of notice Ex.P/3 and explained that after sending the notice Ex.P/3, the matter\\nwas not taken to the Court because the same was got amicably settled through one Anopsingh\\nupon promise of not to beat the deceased by the appellant. He admitted regarding not lodging the\\nreport at the police station against demand of dowry. In para 16, this witness stated about fact of\\nkilling of deceased was disclosed to him by Ganpatsingh and daughter of deceased PW-6\\nKrishnabai. He did not gether any information about this fact from the residents of village\\nLasudia Khema. Again in para 17, he deposed that after marriage of his daughter, he used to\\nvisit the village of appellant and his daughter deceased Kailash Kunwar after seeing him used to\\nweep and complain about beating by the appellant, but he was not disclosing this fact to his\\nfamily members. In para 19, he denied the suggestion of defence counsel that before five years\\nhe went to the appellant and demanded Rs. 5,000/- and because of refusal by the appellant, he\\nconcocted a false case against him.\\n20. On over all perusal of the statement of this witness who is the father of deceased\\nKailash Kunwar I come to only and only irresistible conclusion that the deceased was being ill-\\ntreated in her matrimonial house and the spouse were having strained relations.\\n21. On going through the judgment of the learned Justice Shri Shambhoo Singh, it is found\\nthat on the basis of the statement of prosecution witnesses about strained relations between the\\ntwo families, positive finding in favour of the prosecution or against has not been given and in\\nthe judgment there is no discussion and assessment of notice Ex.P/3, its postal receipt Ex.P/4\\nand letter sent by the Advocate to the Postal Authority about information of service of\\nRegistered Envelope Ex.P/5, whereas, the statement of Nathusingh (PW-5), Ishwarsingh (PW-\\n1), Bhagwansingh (PW-2), father and brothers of the deceased respectively, as well as the\\nstatement of PW-7 Anopsingh (due to typing mistake wrongly mentioned as PW-4 in the\\njudgment of Justice Shri Shambhoo Singh who is in relation of the appellant Jujharsingh, it is\\nestablished without any shadow of doubt that the deceased was ill-treated by the appellant. She\\nwas not provided proper and sufficient food by the appellant in time and he was also beating her.\\nPW-7 Anopsingh is in relation of the appellant and no suggestion is given in cross-examination\\nto him about any strained relations with the appellant or reason for giving statement against\\nthem. In para 13 the only suggestions were given that the deceased Kailash Kunwar and the\\nappellant had no talk with him. The deceased did not disclose any thing to him. He did not see\\nany injury on her person and he also did not admonish the appellant, and the deceased was mad.\\nAll these suggestions have been denied by this witness. In the statement of this witness in para 7\\nonly omission is brought on record in his case-diary statement about non-mention of the fact of\\nseeing the injury on the cheek and head of the deceased. Apart from this, no other omissions,\\ncontradictions or improvements are available though extensive cross-examination of this witness\\nhas been done. To this witness Anopsingh, no suggestion was given by the defence that he was\\nhaving direct relationship with PW-5 Nathusingh. There is no reason to disbelieve this witness.22. For convicting the appellant under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, the prosecution has to\\nestablish that the deceased met a homicidal death amounting to murder. For the purposes of\\nestablishing homicidal death, postmortem report and medical evidence give immense proof but,\\nin the present case, the deceased died in the room of the appellant. Thereafter, funeral was\\nperformed without lodging any report at the Police Station and Postmortem Examination of\\ndeceased Kailash Kunwarbai. The Supreme Court, in the case of Mani Kumar Thapa v. State of\\nSikkim [(2002) 7 S.C.C. 157], has held in para 4, as under:–\\n''It is a well settled principle in law that in a trial for murder, it is neither an absolute\\nnecesssity nor an essential ingredient to establish corpus delicti. The fact of death of the\\ndeceased must be established like any other fact. Corpus delicti in some cases may not be\\npossible to be traced or recovered. There are a number of possibilities where a dead body\\ncould be disposed of without a trace, therefore, if the recovery of the dead body is to be\\nheld to be mandatory to convict an accused, in many a case the accused would manage to\\nsee that the dead body is destroyed which would afford the accused complete immunity\\nfrom being held guilty or from being punished. What is therefore, required in law to base\\na conviction for an offence of murder is that there should be reliable and plausible\\nevidence that the offence of murder like any other factum of death was committed and it\\nmust be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence albeit the dead body may not be\\ntraced. (See: also Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N.)[(1991)3 SCC 471 : 1991 SCC (Cri.\\n724)]. Therefore, the argument that in the absence of corpus delicti the prosecution case\\nshould be rejected, cannot be accepted.''\\n-x- -x- -x-\\nAlso see: State of Karnataka v. M.V. Mahesh [(2003) 3 S.C.C. Page 353 (Para 3)],\\nRamanand and others v. State of Himachal Pradesh, [AIR 1981 S.C. 738. PARAS 26 &\\n27] and Ramchandra and another v. State of UP [AIR 1957 S.C. 381].\\n23. In the instant case, the prosecution has examined eye-witness of the incident Krishnabai\\n(PW-6) , daughter of the appellant aged about six years. The say of this witness is that she and\\nher deceased mother as also the appellant were dwelling in the room of upper floor of the house\\n(first floor). In the night, she and her mother Kailash Kunwar were sitting. The appellant came in\\nthe room and caused kick-blows to her mother and thereafter he pressed her mother's neck. The\\nassualt was made by kicks on the stomach. In cross-examination para 6, a leading question was\\nput to her by the defence counsel that she was sleeping on the ground-floor with her grand-\\nmother, grand-father and uncles Kamalsingh and Saudansingh. She deposed that she was\\nsleeping on the upper portion. Then question was put that 'in the night at what time her mother\\ndied.? She answered ' at 2-1 o'clock in the night'. Then a question was put ''when your father\\nreached in the room.?, she replied '4- 1 o'clock'. Learned defence counsel asked her that she gave\\ntwo different timings and out of those, which was correct, the witness answered '4 o'clock'.\\nAgain a leading question was put that she was sleeping at 4.00 o'clock, she answered that she\\nwas not sleeping. Again a question was put that who told her about beating of her mother? In\\nreply to this question, she deposed that ''accused assaulted her mother''. At that juncture, she had\\ncried. She too was given two slaps by the appellant. Again a leading question was put to her that\\nthe fact of beating told by her maternal grand-father Nathusingh, she answered that she was\\ndeposing the fact which was witnessed by her. Again, in para 9 a leading question was put to her\\nthat she was told all the facts about the case by her maternal grand-father, she refused flatly\\n'NAHIN BATAI THI', Again, she deposed in answer to a question that there was a watch in her\\nhouse and she was knowing to ascertain the time by seeing the watch. When her father assaulted\\nher mother, that time she had ascertained by seeing the watch. Thereafter, she was asked to show\\nthe time by seeing the watch which was fixed in the Court-Room, but she expressed her inability\\nand in her deposition, the Court has put a note that the figures mentioned in the watch were in\\nEnglish language. She further testified in para 11 of her cross-examination that the police\\nrecorded her statement as disclosed by her. She told the police about the time of death of her\\nmother, but after recording the statement police did not read over the same to her. She was asked\\nabout omission of time of death of her mother in her police statement (Ex.D/1). She answered\\nthat she told the time to the police, but she did not know as to why the same was not written in\\nher statement. Again, in cross-examination para 12, this witness has deposed that her statement\\nwas also recorded in Khachrod and she gave the statement that her mother was assaulted by her\\nfather/appellant by kicks and thereafter, he pressed her neck by both hands.\\n24. On going through the statement of this witness, apart from omission of time of incident,\\nin her case-diary statement (Ex.D/2), nothing adverse has been elucidated by the defence. She\\nhas boldly refuted the suggestion and a leading question was put to her about tutoring by her\\nmaternal-grand-father. So far as time factor is concerned, in view of this Court, looking to theage of this witness, much importance cannot be attached, if she was not able to ascertain time by\\nseeing the watch in the Court and gave time. But, according to her, the incident occurred in the\\nnight and she was consistant on this. She also finally stated the time of incident as 4.00 AM. The\\npresence of this witness in the room alongwith the appellant and deceased is firmly established\\nby the prosecution and there is no contradiction available regarding time of incident. There is\\nonly omission in her case-diary statement. On the question of time, while appreciating the\\nevidence of the eye-witnesses in the case of Gurnam Kaur v. Bakshish Singh and others [AIR\\n1981 S.C. 631 in para 8.], the Supreme Court has observed that ''When rustice woman mentioned\\nthe time as 1.00 PM, 2.00 PM, 3.00 PM allowance must be given and the time mentioned should\\nnot be treated as precise. In this judgment, the High Court did not rely on the two eye-witnesses\\nGurnam Kaur and Charan Kaur regarding their presence in the field till 3.00 PM and held that\\nthe incident occurred at 12.00 noon. At that time, both the women must have been in their house\\npreparing lunch. On consideration, the Supreme Court reversed the finding and held about\\nprecision of time above and also held that ''They were not asked in cross-examination why they\\nwere crying in the field till 3.00 PM instead of making ready lunch. If asked, they might have\\ngiven a very plausible explanation.\\n25. In the case in hand, the eye-witness Krishna Bai (PW-6) specifically stated that at the\\ntime of incident, she was sitting with her mother and she was not sleeping. Her father came\\ninside the room and kicked her mother on stomach and also throttled her. This Court does not\\nfind any reason to discard the testimony of this witness on the basis of drawing presumption that\\nshe being a child, must be sleeping and there was no reason for her not to sleep in the dead hour\\nof night or up to 4.00 o'clock. This witness has no-where stated that for the whole night she was\\nawaking. Therefore, it would not be just and proper to draw such inference. In cross-\\nexamination, she has stated plainly that she was sitting with her mother and they were\\nchitchating and at that juncture the appellant entered the room and assaulted the deceased. She\\nhas also stated that in the said night, there was marriage of her uncle, but, she did not go to\\nattend the function because her uncle used to beat her. At this stage, it is made clear that\\nKamalsingh was residing on the lower portion of the same house and if there was marriage\\nfunction in the house this witness could be awaking with her mother. In case of State of UP v.\\nShankar [AIR 1981 S.C. 897], the Apex Court, in para 18, while considering the reason assigned\\nby the High Court to discard the testimony of eye-witness that normally in the village, rural\\npeople usually go to answer the call of nature before sun-rise. Therefore, the occurrence took\\nplace much before sun-rise when it was dark and not at 9.00 AM. The Supreme Court held that\\nsuch generali–sation is not possible. It depends on the habit of individual, state of his health\\nparticular of his digestive system and so many factors. This Court is also of the opinion that the\\ngeneralisation is not possible that the child witness could not remain awaking in the night.\\n26. On careful scrutiny of the statement of the this witness PW-6 Krishnabai, this Court\\ndoes not find any abnormal circumstance to discard her testimony. Learned Shri Justice\\nShambhoo Singh has also relied upon the testimony of this witness for convicting the appellant\\nfor causing beating to deceased in the night. She was disbelieved only for pressing the neck of\\nthe deceased by the appellant causing death and the ground stated for this that if the deceased\\nwas throttled by the appellant, she must have raised cry and also tried and struggled to save\\nherself, but PW-6 Krishnabai did not state that KailashKunwarbai made some noise or struggle.\\nThe question of raising cry and struggle would depend as to how and under what circumstance\\nthe appellant pressed her neck. It was possible that while throttling no chance could be given to\\nthe victim to raise alarm and put resistance. Apart from this, no question was put to this effect to\\nthe eye-witness so that she could explain this circumstance. Therefore, relying on the witness for\\npart of overt act of the appellant of causing kick-blows and discard her version for throttling\\nwould not go parallel. I regret, I am unable to concur with the finding of the learned Justice Shri\\nShambhoo Singh in para 6 that PW-6 Krishnabai was a tutored witness so far as overt act of\\nthrottling/pressing of neck of the deceased by the appellant. Merely because she was a child-\\nwitness, it cannot be presumed that she must have been tutored especially when she stood firm in\\ndetail and incisive cross-examination by the defence counsel. Nothing is brought on record by\\nthe defence to say that she was a tutored witness.\\n27. The Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Bharat Fakir [(2002) 1\\nS.C.C. 622], while reversing the judgment of acquittal passed by the High Court, held that\\n''Merely because a witness is child, his/her evidence is not always liable to be rejected. Where\\nTrial Cort found the testimony of child-witness to be reliable, such witness stood the test of\\nsearching cross-examination, and even otherwise his evidence was supported by a number of\\nother circumstances, the High Court erred in disbelieving the evidence of such witness''.(Emphasis supplied). In the case of State of Karnataka v. Sherrif [AIR 2003 S.C. 1074, (para\\n15)], the Supreme Court, while appreciating the evidence of child-witness discussed as under:–\\n''In our opinion the view taken by the learned Sessions Judge that it would be unsafe to\\nrely upon the testimony of PW-3 regarding the actual factum of incident is not correct. A\\nboy aged 8/9 years would be near his mother and would be sleeping in the same house\\nwhere she was sleeping. There was no occasion for him to go to the house of Jaina Bi and\\nto sleep with her. If PW-3 was not present in the house and was in the house of her grand-\\nmother in the night in question, he could not have conveyed the information about the\\nincident to PW-1 and PW-2 nor they would have come to know about the incident\\nforthwith. If PW-3 was present in the house he was bound to witness the incident, namely\\npicking up quarrel by the accused with his wife and setting her on fire. There was\\nabsolutely no reason why PW-3 would give a false statement against his own father that\\nhe had tied the hands and legs of his mother and had burnt her. We are of the opinion\\nthat the testimony of PW-3 is fairly reliable on the factum of the incident and the same\\ncannot be discarded only on account of a stray sentence in his cross-examination where\\nhe has stated that when his mother caught fire he was in his grand-mother's house. The\\nHigh Court did not examine the testimony of this witness carefully and we find ourselves\\nunable to agree with the view taken by it.''\\n-x- -x- -x-\\nIn the instant case, the child witness PW-6 Krishna Bai did not give any chance to the\\ndefence to bring any such material on the basis of which it can be held that she was not inside\\nthe room with her father and mother and she was tutored for giving the statement in the Court\\nagainst the appellant. Also see: Ratansingh v. State of Gujrat [(2004)1 S.C.C. 64], Suryanarayan\\nv. State of Karnataka [AIR 2001 S.C. 482], Radheshyam v. State of Orissa [(1990) 1 S.C.C. 858\\n(Paras 11 and 12)].\\nIn my opinion, the child witness PW-6 Krishna Bai is fully reliable witness and her\\nstatement is corroborated on material particulars by the statement of PW-1 Ishwarsingh, PW-5\\nNathusingh and PW-4 Goverdhansingh.\\n28. The deceased Kailash Kunwar died inside the house of appellant and if she met the\\nnatural death the appellant should have informed this fact immediately to her parents and other\\nrelations who reside in Vishnu Colony, Dewas, which is not situated at a long distance from\\nvillage Lasudia Khema and situated in the adjacent district of Ujjain. In Hindu community, it is\\na deeply routed tradition and culture to send information before performance of funeral to the\\nnear and dear of the deceased person, especially mother, father, brother, sister and other close\\nrelatives and wait for reasonable time or period for their arrival to participate in the funeral and\\nsee the face of deceased last time before funeral. According to the prosecution case,\\nKailashKunwar died in the intervening night of 6th and 7th May, 1992 and funeral was\\nperformed on 7th May, 1992. PW-5 Nathusingh, father of the deceased has deposed that Ganpat\\nSingh elder brother of appellant reached at Dewas on 08.05.92 and offered seven to eight\\nthousand rupees for not lodging the report because the appellant killed Kailash Kunwar by\\npressing her neck. On this information, he reached at village Lasudiya, met his grand-daughter\\nKrishnabai (PW-6) who disclosed about killing of deceased by appellant by pressing her neck.\\nPW-5 Nathusingh was informed by Ganpat Singh which is amply proved on the basis of the\\nstatement in examination-in-chief as well as in cross-examination. After confirming the\\ninformation, he immediately on 09.05.92 lodged a written complaint to the Police (Ex.P/2). The\\nappellant has not examined any witness in defence to establish as to why before performance of\\nfuneral the appellant did not inform father and brother of the deceased. In accused statement\\nrecorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. also, he has not assigned any reason for not giving\\ninformation about demise of KailashKunwar before funeral. He has also not examined his\\nbrother Ganpat Singh to contradict the statement of PW-5 Nathusingh about giving him the\\ninformation. In answer to question No.6, regarding information given by his brother Ganpat\\nSingh to Nathu Singh (PW-5), he has given simple answer of denial. The appellant has also not\\nexplained as to why information was not given to the police about death of his wife especially\\nwhen he was not having cordial relations with his in-laws. The way in which funeral was\\nperformed, hurriedly, is a strong circumstance against the appellant and this abnormal and\\nunusual conduct is admissible under Section 8 of the Evidence Act and this circumstance also\\nstrengthens the eye-witness's account of daughter of appellant PW-6 Krishnabai. See Alamgir v.\\nState [(2003) 1 S.C.C. 21] (Placi-D) and D'Souza Anthony v. State of Karnataka [(2003) 1\\nS.C.C. 259] (Placi-C).29. In the statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the appellant's defence was that the\\ndeceased met a natural death and PW-5 Nathusingh is speaking against him because he did not\\ngive him money. In cross-examination, in para 9 Nathusingh has denied the defence suggestion\\nthat before five years from the date of his examination in Court i.e. 18.01.93, he demanded Rs.\\n5,000/- (rupees five thousand) from the appellant and because of non-payment, he concocted a\\nfalse case against him. This defence does not sound well. It is not a case that after the death of\\nKailash Kunwarbai, her father PW-5 Nathusigh demanded money from the appellant and on-\\nnon-payment thereof he concocted a false case against him. According to the defence, the\\ndemand was much before the death of KailashKunwarbai. Burden lies on the appellant to prove\\nthat the deceased died a natural death. In his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the\\nappellant has no-where stated that his wife deceased Kailash Kunwar was suffering from mental\\ndisorder and was having recurring attack and she reached the chronic stage. He simply stated in\\nanswer to question No. 44 that he is innocent and KailashKunwar Bai met a natural death. The\\nsame statement he has given in defence plea. In defence, he examined DW 1 Rajesh Sanghvi. Dr.\\nSanghvi was posted in Mental Hospital, Indore as Assistant Surgeon on 08.07.92. He proved the\\nCertificate Ex. D/7 dated 08.07.92 regarding treatment of deceased Kailash Kunwarbai who was\\nsuffering from manic deppressive psychosis. He also proved the record of out door patient of\\nKailash Kunwar vide Ex. D/8 and D/9. In para 3, he deposed that in this disease there is no\\npossibility of death in ordinary course of nature, but if the patient goes in deep deppressive\\nmania, there is possibility of death and such kind of severe attack may come once in a year or\\ntwo years. In cross-examination, he has deposed that it is not necessary that on attack in all\\nprobability the patient would die. He lastly examined KailashKunwar on 29.01.91.\\n30. On perusal of the certificate (Ex. D/7), it is evident that first time Kailash Kunwarbai\\nwas examined in the mental hospital, Indore on 01.07.89, in the month of July and thereafter, in\\nOctober and December, 1989. She was treated and then she was examined again on 12.02.90 and\\nlastly on 29.01.91. This Certificate (Ex.D/7) was given on the basis of OPD ticket No. 1100\\ndated 01.07.89. Dr Sanghvi (DW-1) also proved the documents of treatment Ex.D/8-C dated\\n01.07.89 in four pages and Ex. D/9 in eight pages. These are all photo-stat copies of the\\ndocuments of treatment of deceased relied upon by the defence. On first examination on\\n01.07.89, in the out-Door Patient Card, it is mentioned under the head of 'Family History' that\\nthe deceased was residing with her father-in-law and mother-in-law, quarrel used to take place in\\nthe house, husband used to beat her, financial condition was weak, insufficiency of food and lack\\nof sleep. She used to cry, beat and behave violently. This history of the patient itself is revealing\\nthat she was the victim of the appellant and his family members. For the first time, she was\\ntreated on 01.07.89 much after her marriage and her delivery of one female child. DW-1 Dr\\nSanghvi on the basis of these documents gave certificate Ex. D/7 dated 08.07.92 and in this\\ncertificate as well as in the treatment documents Ex. D/8 and D/9, no where it is mentioned that\\nshe had possibility of death because of manic attack. Admittedly DW-1 Dr Sanghvi did not see\\nand examine the body of deceased. For the first time in Court on the basis of the aforesaid old\\ndocuments and lastly the deceased was treated by him on 29.01.91, he gave opinion regarding\\npossibility of her death because of excessive deppression or Mania. This opinion is neither here\\nnor there and also has no sound and concrete basis. By no stretch of imagination, such kind of\\nhypothetical Expert Opinion can be relied upon for establishing the fact even by preponderence\\nof probabilities regarding death of deceased especially when ocular account is available for\\nhomicidal death, evidence of motive and abnormal conduct of the appellant.\\n31. I do not find any substance in the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the\\nappellant for non-examination of Badrilal and Prabhu Singh who were the witnesses regarding\\nseeing of the dead body of Kailash Kunwar. First of all, both the witnesses were given up by\\nthe prosecution on 19.01.04. Prabhu Singh was given up on the ground of his being won-over.\\nWhether they found any mark of violence or struggle on her person or not is not very material, in\\nthe absence of medical evidence and postmortem report. The prosecution case is not that on the\\nperson of the deceased mark of violence and struggle were present which is contrary to the\\nstatements of these two witnesses, as discussed hereinabove. The question of presence of mark\\nof violence and struggle depends as to how and under what circumstances, the deceased was\\nthrottled and no question was put to the eye-witness to this effect. Therefore, non-examination of\\nthese two witnesses would not give any benefit to the appellant and no adverse inference can be\\ndrawn against the prosecution. Since the deceased died in the house of the appellant and without\\nlodging report at the Police Station and without conduction of the postmortem examination\\nfuneral was performed. Therefore, it was incumbant upon the appellant to explain all these\\ncircumstances and he should have examined the villagers to establish the circumstances\\nfavourable to him, but he has not done so.32. Thus, for the reasons indicated hereinabove, I am in agreement with the then Justice Shri\\nR.D. Vyas and respectfully disagree with the opinion of the then Justice Shri Shambhoo Singhji.\\nTherefore, the appeal preferred by the appellant is laible to be dismissed.\\n33. Now the matter be laid before the Division Bench for final disposal.\\n---------\",\n",

Thereafter the\\nappellant also assaultled aunt of the prosecutrix named Lalkibai on which she had also\\nhidden herself in the darkness. Thereafter the appellant ravished the prosecutrix against\\nher consent and will and ran away. The prosecutrix raised alaram upon which her aunt,\\nuncle and husband returned back to the hut before whom she has disclosed about the\\nincident. They went to their master Indersingh and informed about the said incident. They\\nthen went to police chowky Kampel and lodged the report. On the basis of this report,\\nthe Crime was registered in police station Khudel. After due investigation, chargesheet\\nwas filed for the offence U/Ss. 376, 323, 506(I) IPC and Sec.3 (2) (5) of Scheduled Caste\\nand Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.\\nBefore the learned trial Court, appellant denied the charges and his defence was that\\nhis agricultural land was situated adjacent to the land of Indersingh, the master of the\\nprosecutrix and her family members and because of dispute over the land the prosecutrix\\nand her family members had lodged a false report at the instance of Indersingh. The\\nappellant did not examine any witness in defence. In trial, the appellant has been\\nconvicted only for the offence U/S. 376 of IPC and acquitted the appellant from other\\ncharges. Hence this appeal before this Court.\\nThe learned counsel for appellant has submitted that the prosecutrix and other\\nwitnesses have turned hostile. The statement of prosecutrix has not been corroborated by\\nthe medical evidence. The totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecutrix is\\ndisclosing the fact that some unknown person reached at the hutment of the prosecutrix in\\nthe night and assaulted them. Thereafter a false report has been lodged against theappellant at the instance of Indersingh (PW.3). The L.C. has also submitted that there is\\nno reliable and admissible evidence available in the case to sustain the conviction of the\\nappellant.\\nPer contra, the L.C. for State has supported the impugned judgment and finding\\npassed by the Court below.\\nHaving heard the L.C. for parties and after perusing the entire record, this Court is of\\nthe opinion that the evidence of the prosecutrix Basantibai (PW.1) is not at all reliable\\nfor basing conviction because in examination-in-chief she has not supported the\\nprosecution case and denied even the lodging of F.I.R. (Ex.P.1). She was declared\\nhostile and in cross examination also she has denied the lodging of the report but in\\nparagraphs 5, 6 and 7 she has stated that the appellant had assaulted her uncle, aunt and\\nhusband, thereafter entered inside the hut and committed bad act (khottakaam) with her.\\nAgain in cross examination by the counsel for appellant, she has denied the contents as\\nstated by her in cross examination by the Prosecutor and deposed that appellant had not\\ncommitted any bad act with her. Her say was that in the night thieves entered inside the\\nhouse and assaulted them. The learned trial Court, while appreciating the evidence of\\nthis witness, has held that it appears that she had given her statement in Court under\\npressure of somebody. The learned trial Court has acquitted the appellant from the\\noffences punishable U/Ss.323, 506(i) of IPC and Sec.3 (2)(5) of Scheduled Caste &\\nScheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and relying on some part of the\\nevidence of the prosecutrix. holding that the same has been corroborated by the evidence\\nof Ajabsingh @ Bhuria (PW.5), Gusai (PW.4), Indersingh (PW.3) and Amarsingh\\n(PW.7), convicted the appellant U/S. 376 of IPC.\\nIn cross examination by the Prosecutor, the prosecutrix has denied the lodging of\\nF.I.R. (Ex.P.1) and her statement (Ex.P.2). All the contents of the report and the\\nstatement were disowned by the prosecutrix. She has nowhere stated in her statement that\\nafter the incident she has disclosed the same to other witnesses Indersingh (PW.3), Gusai\\n(PW.4), Ajabsingh @ Bhuria (PW.5), Pyarsingh (PW.6) and Amarsingh (PW.7). Since\\nthe prosecutrix has not stated in her deposition that she has disclosed about the incident to\\nother witnesses, the evidence of other witnesses in this regard would not be admissible\\nand same be hit by the rule of hearsay evidence. See (Dinanath Singh and others v. The\\nState of Bihar1) and (Yasin Gulam Haider v. State of Maharashtra2).\\nIn the case of Dinanath Singh (supra), the Apex Court has held as under:-\\n''Thereafter Bhagwati Pandey took out a CHHURA from his waist and stabbed\\nthe deceased, Bhagwan Singh P.W.10, however, had made no such statement in\\nhis evidence. He never claims to have made any such statement to P.W.3. Thus\\nP.W.3, seems to be more loyal than the King in attributing a statement to\\nBhagwan Singh which in fact were never made to him, and thus if P.W.10 is to\\nbe believed then evidence of p.W.3 is hearsay and therefore, inadmissible''.\\nIn the case of Yasin Gulam Haider (supra), the Supreme Court has also held as\\nunder:-\\n''It appears that the name of the appellant came to light immediately when the\\nvictim was taken to the Hospital and the Doctor was told by Godabai, P.W.8 andthe appellant had assaulted Namdeo. Godabai when examined as a witness did\\nnot support the Doctor. Thereafter the evidence of the Doctor remains hearsay\\nand, hence, inadmissible. Godabai resiled from her statement before the police\\nand is, therefore, an unreliable witness. Her statement before the Police could not\\nbe used to corroborate the prosecution or to convict the appellant''.\\nLalkibai (PW.2) is the aunt of the prosecutrix. She has also been turned hositle. Her\\npresence was admitted by the prosecutrix and it was the prosecution case that she was\\npresent and also assaulted by the appellant. But this witness has said that she was not\\nknowing appellant Parvatsingh and on the date of incident, in the night at 11.00 p.m.\\nthieves came to their hut on which she had ran away. In cross examination, she denied\\ncontents of her case diary statement (Ex.P.4). She has also stated that Basantibai did not\\ndisclosed anything before her. Indersingh (PW.3) who was the master of the prosecutrix\\nand her husband has stated that the prosecutrix had disclosed about the incident to him.\\nThis statement of Indersingh is not admissible as stated hereinabove.\\nThe learned trial Court has disbelieved the prosecution story about assault by the\\nappellant to prosecutrix and her uncle Gusai (PW.4) and husband Pyarsingh (PW.6) and\\nacquitted the appellant from the charges of causing simple injury and delivery of threat.\\nWhen the witnesses have not been relied upon for initial incident of assault to four\\npersons by lathi by the appellant, and prosecutrix has turned hostile, there is no\\ncorroboration to her testimony by any admissible evidence, in such situation, the\\nconviction of the appellant is not sustainable. The learned trial Court has sought\\ncorroboration of the testimony of the prosecutrix from the inadmissible evidence on\\nrecord. The learned trial Court has disbelieved the statement of Pyarsingh (PW.6) who is\\nthe husband of the prosecutrix about the incident of beating to them by the appellant\\n(See paragraphs 10 and 11 of the judgment).\\nThe prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Malti Solanki (PW.15). She did not find any\\nexternal or internal injury on the person of the prosecutrix and expressed her inebility to\\ngive any opinion about commission of rape upon the prosecutrix.\\nLooking to the hesitant and divergent statement of the prosecutrix regarding\\nincident and there is no corroboration available to her testimony by any independent\\nmaterial purticulars, it would be very difficult to convict the appellant on the basis of\\npicking up or one or two sentences from the statement of the prosecutrix. Therefore, this\\nCourt is of the considered view that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the\\nguilt of the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt. Therefore, the appellant is entitled for\\nacquittal.\\nIn the result, the appeal is allowed. Conviction and sentence of the appellant U/S.\\n376 of IPC is hereby set aside. The learned trial Court is directed to release the appellant\\nforthwith if not required in any other criminal case.\\nAppeal allowed.\\n----------\",\n",

Prem Lata Sood reported in\\n2007 Vol.11 S.C.C. 40; (2007 (7) Scale 737).\\nt\\nThe challenge to thre respondents’ action is on the ground\\nu\\nthat as on the date of the last extension granted by the Municipal\\no\\nauthorities, the law with regard to the development and construction of\\nthe building stoCod changed by virtue of the notifications dated 11th\\nAugust, 2000 and 22nd August, 2002 issued under the “Development\\nAct” , htherefore no extension based on the old sanction could have\\nbeen granted.\\ng\\nThe learned counsels for the respondents have argued\\ni\\nH\\nthat the petitioners’ case is not of erection of a new building but,\\nhowever, addition/alteration on the already existing structure and\\ntherefore the petitioners’ application for extension had to be considered\\nand allowed on the basis of laws existing as on the date of the original\\nsanction.\\nThe relevant portion, necessary for adjudication of the\\nwrit petition, of both the notifications is reproduced as under:\\n”Dated:11th August, 2000.\\n(a) All Private as well as Government constructions\\nare totally banned within the core area of Shimla\\nPlanning Area.

No permission whatsoevrer was required to be obtained or\\nu\\naccorded under the provisions of the “Planning Act” or “Development\\no\\nPlan”.\\nHoCwever, sanction to erect a building under Section 243\\nor make additions or repairs of a building under Section 244\\nnecessharily have to be in accordance with the provisions of the\\n“Development Plan” prepared under the provisions of the Development\\ng\\nPlan. It is quite evident from the following observations made by the\\ni\\nH\\napex Court in Smt. Prem Lata Sood’s case (supra):\\n“34. Section 243 of the 1994 Act clearly mandates that\\nerection of a building must precede grant of express\\nsanction of a building plan. How and in what manner the\\nsame is required to be dealt with is provided in Sections\\n244 and 245 of the 1994 Act. Clause (s) of sub-section\\n(2) of Section 246 in no uncertain terms restrict the power\\nof the appellant-Corporation to grant sanction for\\nerection, inter alia, for development of an area by way of\\nerection of a building or otherwise, not only if the same is\\nnot in conformity with the building bye-laws, but also if it\\ncontravenes any other law or rules operating in the field.\\n35. The 1977 Act is one of such Act. As noticed\\nhereinbefore, the provisions thereof are binding upon the\\nlocal authority. Once the provisions there of are held to\\nbe binding, the law made by the State by way of\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:13 :::CIS2008:HHC:1500\\n7\\n.\\nP\\nsubordinate legislation in the form of the regulations\\n.\\nand/or notifications issued under sub-sections (4) and (5)\\nH\\nof Section 17 of the 1977 Act would also be binding.\\nIndisputably, the Municipal Corporation would not have\\nany authority to grant any sanctionf in violation thereof.”\\no\\nTherefore the law existing as on the date of the\\nconsideration of the application for exte nsion which in the present case\\nt\\nwas 5th October, 2002 necessarily had to be considered and extension\\nr\\naccorded in terms thereof. u\\nIt is not othe case of either of the respondents that the\\nprocess of construction, alteration or completion had commenced\\nC\\nwithin the period stipulated in terms of the sanction date i.e. 26th\\nMarch, 1998. No material has been placed on record to show as to\\nh\\nwhat transpired between 26th March, 1998 and 5th October, 2002. The\\ng\\naddition/alteration as per original sanction granted on 27th March, 1993\\ni\\nH was statutorily required to be commenced within the statutory period of\\none year so provided under Section 247(3) of the Municipal Act. The\\npower of the Commissioner to grant extension, as stipulated under\\nSection 251 of the Municipal Act is not in dispute. What has been\\ndisputed is the action of the Commissioner to accord such sanction in\\nviolation of the existing laws relevant at the time of the consideration of\\nthe application for extension.\\nIn the instant case the construction not having\\ncommenced and no extension having obtained within the period of one\\nyear the private respondents had to give a notice under Section 244 of\\nthe “Municipal Act” and the case had to be decided as such. This is\\nquite evident from Section 244 read with Section 247(3) of the\\nMunicipal Act. It is true that the notification dated 22nd August, 2002\\ndoes not have retrospective effect, nor does it take away the right of a\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:13 :::CIS2008:HHC:1500\\n8\\n.\\nP\\nperson in whose favour the permission stands granted prior to the\\n.\\nissuance of the notification. But it is equally true, that asH on this date\\nthe private respondents had not commenced the construction in\\naccordance with the prescribed time frame, thefrefore fresh permission\\no\\ncould have been accorded only on the basis of existing law. The\\nextensions granted after 22nd August, 2002 are therefore contrary to\\nt\\nthe Prevalent Law. r\\nu\\nThe learned senior counsel for the private respondents\\no\\nhas argued that the petitioners’ case is not covered by the notification\\ndated 11th AuguCst, 2000 or 22nd August, 2002. The notification dated\\n11th August, 2000 stood substituted by the subsequent notification\\ndated h22nd August, 2002 and the said notification in any case,\\nbeing the law had to be applied for new constructions/sanctions. The\\ng\\nissue is more about application than interpretation of these\\ni\\nH\\nnotifications.\\nIt is true, as has been contended by the learned counsel\\nfor the respondents, in opposition to the submission made by the\\nlearned counsel for the petitioners, that the facts of Smt. Prem Lata\\nSood (supra) are not identical to the facts of the present case. But,\\nhowever, the reliance on Smt. Prem Lata Sood is only for the purpose\\nof true construction of the relevant provisions of the statute in issue.\\nThe learned counsel for the respondents have themselves placed\\nstrong reliance on para-49 of the said judgment to contend that their\\ncase is identical to the one in which the apex court has carved out an\\nexception. I am afraid it is not so. In the referred case Live Oak Resort\\n(P) Ltd. and another Vs. Panchgani Hill Station Municipal Council and\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:13 :::CIS2008:HHC:1500\\n9\\n.\\nP\\nanother, (2001 8 Supreme Court Cases 329, the construction had\\n.\\nalready commenced as per the rules prevalent at that timeH.\\nThe submission made by the respondents that the\\npetition should be dismissed on the ground of dfelay and laches needs\\no\\nto be rejected. The petitioners brought the matter to the notice of the\\nMunicipal authority on 31st January, 2003 and 4th January, 2003 but\\nt\\nthe respondent-Corporation dird not take any conclusive action,\\nu\\ntherefore, they were forced to file the present writ petition before this\\nCourt on 20th Decembeo r, 2003.\\nIt isC true that the petitioners have made factually incorrect\\naverments in the petition, obviously with the intension of mis-leading\\nthis Cohurt and obtaining interim order in their favour. It has come on\\nrecord that the private respondents’ construction stood almost\\ng\\ncompleted on the date when the petition was filed. Therefore, the\\ni\\nH\\npetitioners have deliberately mis-led by falsely averring that the\\nrespondents have started construction of a new building. The\\npetitioners filed the petition only after the proceedings initiated by the\\nland-lord were compromised. This only shows that the petitioners’\\naction is not bonafide but, however, I am not inclined to dismiss the\\npetition on this ground as larger public interest is involved and in view\\nof Articles 141 and 144 of the Constitution of India every authority is\\nduty bound to comply with the directions issued by the apex Court from\\ntime to time. In Smt. Prem Lata Sood (supra) the apex Court has held\\nas under:\\n“Furthermore, since special regulations have been\\nframed in the town of Shimla, the core area as provided\\nfor in the regulation is required to be protected.

The last advertisement was published in three\\ng\\nnewspapers on 15th March, 2008, in which one offer of Rs.46.00\\ni\\nH lacs was received on 9th April, 2008 from one Shri Naveen Bahri.\\nThereafter the Corporation felt that this amount was not\\ncommensurate with the true value of the property, which was\\nassessed at Rs.79.00 lacs. It therefore issued a fresh maximum\\nbid notice, which was published in three newspapers on 28th\\nApril, 2008, copy of which was also sent to the petitioner. In this\\nmaximum bid notice, it was clearly mentioned that the bids\\noffered should not be less than Rs.46.00 lacs, which bid had\\nalready been received by the Corporation. Admittedly, the\\npetitioner did not send any bid in response to this notice. As per\\nthis notice, offers were to be negotiated on 14th May, 2008. As\\non 14th May, 2008, the respondent-Corporation received only two\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 3 -\\nbids, one from the original bidder Shri Naveen Bahri and ano.ther\\nP\\nfrom Sh.

Negotiations were held and\\n.\\nShri Naveen Bahri increased his offer from Rs.46.00 lacs to\\nH\\nRs.60.00 lacs and Shri Ram Kumar, who had initially offered\\nRs.50.00 lacs increased his offer to Rs.5f5.00 lacs.\\no\\nBefore any other action could be taken on the offers made\\nby Shri Naveen Bahri and tShri Ram Kumar, the Corporation\\nr\\nallegedly received another bid on 15th May, 2008. This bid was\\nu\\nreceived from M/s R.P. Singh and K.D. Sharma of Una, whereby\\no\\nthey offered Rs.65.00 lacs and offered to pay the amount on\\nC\\ndown payment basis. They also deposited Rs.10,00 lacs along\\nwith their bid. The respondent-Corporation accepted the bid of\\nh\\nM/s R.P. Singh and K.D. Sharma on 21st May, 2008 and\\ng\\npossession of the property was handed over to successful bidder\\ni\\nH on 23rd May, 2008.\\nThe case of the petitioner is that the respondent No.1 has\\nbeen given a back-door entry to the respondent No.2 in the\\nbidding process. Admittedly, respondent No.2 did not bid either\\nin response to the advertisement issued on 15th March, 2008 or\\nin response to the advertisement issued on 28th April, 2008. He\\nhad not submitted any bid by 14th May, 2008. Their bid was\\nallegedly submitted only on the next date i.e. on 15th May, 2008.\\nIn the meantime, the petitioner had sent a FAX message along\\nwith FAX copies of the drafts amounting to Rs.18.00 lacs, drawn\\nin favour of H.P.F.C and this letter was admittedly received by\\nFAX in the office of H.P.F.C. on 17th May, 2009 at 2.30 p.m. The\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 4 -\\npetitioner had also stated that he shall produce the original dr.afts\\nP\\nbefore H.P.F.C. on 19th May, 2008.\\n.\\nIt is urged on behalf of the petitioner that when the\\nH\\npetitioner had made such an offer, the H.P.F.C. should have\\nnegotiated with him and given him somef reasonable time to pay\\no\\nthe entire dues. It is argued that the H.P.F.C. has acted in a\\nhighly unfair and unreasonabtle manner and legal mala fides are\\nr\\nwrit large.\\nu\\nOn the other hand, Shri Ajay Kumar, learned counsel for\\no\\nHimachal Pradesh Financial Corporation has urged that the\\nC\\nH.P.F.C. has taken the best commercial decision on the basis of\\ndocuments on record. It is argued that the petitioner despite\\nh\\nmaximum accommodation being given to him did not bring any\\ng\\nbuyer nor offered to pay any substantial amount to settle the loan\\ni\\nH prior to dealing with respondent No.2. It has also been urged that\\nthe offers made by Shri Naveen Bahri and Shri Ram Kumar were\\nless than the offer made by respondent No.2, therefore, keeping\\nin view the interest of the Corporation, the offer made by\\nrespondent No.2 was accepted.\\nShri Neeraj Kumar Sharma, learned counsel for\\nrespondent No.2 urges that the petitioner cannot be permitted to\\nrake up this plea at this belated stage. According to him, one of\\nthe conditions mentioned in the advertisement dated 28th April,\\n2008 was that the H.P.F.C. had a right to accept any bid\\nreceived after the date fixed also. It is also urged that this Court\\nshould not sit in appeal over the decision of the H.P.F.C. The\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 5 -\\ndecision has been taken in commercial interest and this C.ourt\\nP\\ncannot substitute its judgment for the said decision. Shri Neeraj\\n.\\nK. Sharma further submitted that no case of mala fides has\\nH\\nbeen made out and the Corporation has acted in a fair and\\nreasonable manner and therefore, fthe decision of the\\no\\nCorporation should not be interfered with. He also urges that the\\npetitioner cannot be permittetd to bring a better buyer during the\\nr\\npendency of the writ petition. According to him, this cannot be\\nu\\ndone because due to the passage of time, the value of the\\no\\nproperty has increased.\\nC\\nWe have carefully perused the entire record of the case as\\nwell as the files produced by the Himachal Pradesh Financial\\nh\\nCorporation before us.\\ng\\nThis court has no concern with what happened prior to 14th\\ni\\nH May, 2008. Even as per the case set up by the Corporation on\\nfour occasions no bids were received. In case no bids were\\nreceived, it is obvious that the property had to be put to auction\\nor put up for sale again. On the fifth occasion, i.e. pursuant to the\\nadvertisement notice dated 15th March, 2008, only one bidder\\nmade an offer. This offer was for Rs.46.00 lacs. Thereafter the\\nCorporation decided, and in our opinion rightly so, to issue fresh\\nnotice asking any person to better the highest bid received. The\\ncourse adopted by the Corporation was transparent and a copy\\nof this notice was also sent to the petitioner informing him that he\\ncould also make a better offer or bring a better buyer. As noted\\nabove, only two persons turned up pursuant to this notice and\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 6 -\\nrespondent No.2 was not in the picture at that stage. The rec.ord\\nP\\nreveals that after negotiations were held, Shri Naveen Bahri\\n.\\nmade the highest offer of Rs. 60.00 lacs. On the next date,\\nH\\nrespondent No.2 appeared out of thin air and made an offer of\\nRs.65.00 lacs. Reliance has been plafced on the terms and\\no\\nconditions of the sale (Annexure R-10), which reads as follows:-\\n“15. The Corporationt shall have the right to entertain\\nr\\nany bidder/ offerer for negotiations even if offer/ bid\\nu\\naccompanied with required earnest money is received\\no\\nafter the stipulated date.”\\nC\\nIt is pertinent to note that neither in the advertisement\\nnotice dated 15th March, 2008 nor in the advertisement notice\\nh\\ndated 28th April, 2008, there is any reference to these terms and\\ng\\nconditions. The only note, which makes reference is Note No.1\\ni\\nH of the advertisement which provides that the offer should be\\nmade on the application form prescribed by the Corporation\\nwhich also contains the detailed terms and conditions of the sale.\\nIt is obvious that only a person who obtains the prescribed\\napplication form would be aware of the conditions contained\\ntherein. The application form in favour of respondent No.2 was\\nissued only on 15th May, 2008. Therefore, prior to this date, he\\ncould not have been aware that there was any condition that\\nsuch an application form could be accepted by the Corporation\\neven after the date fixed. Even otherwise, we are clearly of the\\nopinion that the power of entertaining and negotiating with\\nbidders after the due date can only be exercised in exceptional\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 7 -\\ncases e.g. when no bids are received by the due date, or. the\\nP\\nbidders have formed a cartel or where the bids received by the\\n.\\ndue date are extremely low. There must be some valid reasons\\nH\\nto exercise such powers. However these powers cannot be used\\nto give a back-door entry to some newf bidder. Otherwise the\\no\\nresults will be catastrophic. A person who is introduced at a later\\nstage would know the bids/ otffers made already and can easily\\nr\\nbetter the same.\\nu\\nIn the present case, the bids were opened and\\no\\nnegotiations were held with the bidders on 14th May, 2008. The\\nC\\nresult of the negotiation was public knowledge by the evening. It\\nwas very easy thereafter for any other person including the\\nh\\nrespondent No.2 to make a higher bid on the next day. This will\\ng\\nmake the entire process of bidding a farce.\\ni\\nH The stand of the Corporation as well as respondent No.2\\nis that the offer of Rs.65.00 lacs was made on 15th May, 2008.\\nThis stand is totally belied from the fact that the application form\\nthough sold on 15th May, 2008 is filled up on 16th May, 2008.The\\nendorsement on the top of the form shows that it was received in\\nthe office of the HPFC on 16th May, 2008. In Col. No.3 of the\\nform, it is mentioned that an amount of Rs.10.00 lacs has been\\nreceived in cash along with form. This clause reads as under:-\\n“3. A demand draft/ cash receipt bearing No.____\\ndated_____ drawn for Rs. 1000000/- (Rupees Ten Lac\\nonly) on account of earnest money equivalent to 10%\\nof the assessed value of the assets is enclosed.”\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 8 -\\nIn this form, the receipt number and date have been left blan.k. It\\nP\\nis apparent that till that time, the amount of Rs.10 lakhs had not\\n.\\nbeen deposited and therefore, the receipt number had not been\\nH\\nentered in the form. Thus, both respondents are making false\\nstatements before this Court. f\\no\\nThe amount of earnest money of Rs. 10.00 lacs was\\ndeposited in cash. It purportts to have been deposited on 15th\\nr\\nMay, 2008. We fail to understand how this amount of Rs.10.00\\nu\\nlacs could have been deposited on 15th May, 2008, when the\\no\\nform was filled in, signed and received by the HPFC on 16th May,\\nC\\n2008. On 15th May, 2008 a detailed note was prepared by the\\nJunior Manager (Sales), which makes no reference to any offer\\nh\\nhaving been made by respondent No.2. This file was then\\ng\\nsubmitted to Assistant General Manager as well as Deputy\\ni\\nH General Manager on the same date and then to the Managing\\nDirector of the Corporation. Then on 16th May, 2008, the file is\\nwithdrawn to process the fresh offer of Rs.65.00 lacs. It is more\\nthan obvious that the application was submitted and the cash\\ndeposited only on 16th May, 2008.\\nThe way in which this case proceeded thereafter in the\\nCorporation makes depressing reading with regard to the\\nmanner in which Senior Officers deal with public funds and\\nproperty. On 16th May, 2008 itself the Junior Manager (Sales)\\nprepared another note in which he took note of the fresh offer of\\nRs. 65.00 lacs made by respondent No.2 The Junior Manager\\nexpressed the view that since this was a fresh offer, the matter\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 9 -\\nshould be negotiated with the two original bidders also. This .was\\nP\\na very just and reasonable proposal, because if the rights of\\n.\\nother parties who had already made concrete bids were to be\\nH\\naffected, they should also be given an opportunity to raise their\\nbids. The offer made by respondent Nfo.2 at the back of Shri\\no\\nNaveen Bahri and Shri Ram Kumar could not have been\\naccepted without giving themt a reasonable opportunity to better\\nr\\nthe offer made by respondent No.2. The note of the Junior\\nu\\nManager (Sales) was approved by the Assistant General\\no\\nManager. According to him, fresh round of negotiation should be\\nC\\nheld with the highest two bidders so that they would be given a\\nchance to further increase their offers.\\nh\\nWe must keep in mind the fact that all these offers were\\ng\\nwell below the price, which was got assessed by the Corporation\\ni\\nH itself and therefore, the Corporation was well aware that the\\nmarket price of the property was higher than the bids it had\\nreceived.\\nThe file thereafter was put up to the Managing Director of\\nthe Corporation, who appended the following note:-\\n“ May kindly like to examine last offer in view of the\\nsale Policy of the Corporation. Should we settle the\\ndeal here itself or still go in for negotiation even now.”\\nThis note is dated 17th May, 2008. The note was put up for\\nconsideration of the General Manager, who opined that as per\\nthe Sale Policy, the case falls within the parameters of the policy\\nand the power lies with the Managing Director to decide the\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 10 -\\nsame. It would be pertinent to mention that no such sale po.licy\\nP\\nhas been filed by the HPFC nor produced before us till date. It\\n.\\nwas also mentioned that the offer made by respondent No.2 was\\nH\\nthe highest and respondent No.2 had made an offer on cash\\ndown payment basis and it could be accfepted as per the norms.\\no\\nThereafter the Managing Director made a note that the last offer\\nof Rs.65.00 lacs be acceptedt because of it being a cash down\\nr\\noffer and also since it was the highest offer and the fact that\\nu\\ndespite best efforts, the property could not be sold for the last\\no\\ntwo years. The file was then marked to the Deputy General\\nC\\nManager (LNT) and signed by him. It appears that this file was\\nactually signed on 19th May, 2008, but thereafter overwriting was\\nh\\nmade so as to show that this file was signed on 17th May, 2008,\\ng\\nbut to the naked eye, it is apparent that this file was actually\\ni\\nH signed on 19th May, 2008. This fact becomes relevant and\\nmaterial because in the meantime on 17th May, 2008, the\\npetitioner had sent a FAX letter to the Corporation. He also sent\\nFAX copies of three drafts drawn in favour of the HPFC, i.e. one\\nbank draft for Rs.10.00 lacs drawn on the Punjab National\\nBank, the second for a sum of Rs.7.00 lacs drawn on ICICI\\nBank Ltd. and the third one for a sum of Rs.5.00 lacs drawn\\non AXIS Bank. Thus by the evening of 17th May, 2008, the\\nCorporation was aware that the petitioner-loanee had got\\nprepared drafts of Rs.18.00 lacs, which were payable to it. The\\npetitioner had also clearly stated in his letter dated 17th May,\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 11 -\\n2008 addressed to the Corporation that he would submit .the\\nP\\noriginal drafts on 19th May, 2008.\\n.\\nOn 19th May, 2008, fresh noting was prepared by the\\nH\\nJunior Manager (Sales), in which he wrote that the loanee had\\nalso offered a sum of Rs.18.00 lacs anfd he put up the matter\\no\\nbefore the higher authorities to consider whether the Corporation\\nshould go ahead with the salte process with the respondent No.2\\nr\\nor the petitioner be given another chance to pay the balance\\nu\\namount. It appears that the matter was discussed by some\\no\\nOfficers of the Corporation and the default of the petitioner was\\nC\\ngot worked out and assessed at Rs.66,52,394/-. Thereafter, a\\nnote was put up by the Chief General Manager that in view of the\\nh\\nfact that the loanee has deposited Rs.18.00 lacs, therefore, one\\ng\\noption before the Corporation was to call for the loanee and\\ni\\nH explore the possibility of clearance of entire outstanding liabilities\\nof Rs.48,52,394/- along with future interest especially in view of\\nthe fact that he had paid an amount of Rs.18.00 lacs. He also\\nmade an alternative proposal that the Corporation may decide to\\ngo ahead with the sale and issue acceptance letter. This noting\\nis dated 21st May, 2008. It is thus obvious that till 21st May, 2008,\\nno acceptance letter had been issued to respondent No.2 and\\nthe matter was still under consideration of the Corporation.\\nAfter going through the entire record, we are of the\\nconsidered view that though two options were put forth by the\\nCGM of the Corporation, the first option was the more fair and\\nreasonable option, since it gave a chance to the loanee to pay\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 12 -\\nthe balance amount. The least the Corporation should have d.one\\nP\\nwas to have called the loanee and asked him whether he is\\n.\\nwilling to pay the entire outstanding dues within next 15 days or\\nH\\nso. It would have been most reasonable in case the Corporation\\nhad given the petitioner a reasonable tfime to pay the balance\\no\\namount. In case the petitioner had not paid this amount during\\nthis period the Corporation mtay have been justified in selling the\\nr\\nUnit to respondent No.2.\\nu\\nHowever, we find that the Managing Director took a\\no\\ndecision which in our opinion is totally unreasonable and unfair.\\nC\\nThe note of the Managing Director reads as follows:\\n“GHORA GHAAS SE DOSTI KAREGA TO KHAYEGA\\nh\\nKYA. For us in HPFC recovering our dues from\\ng\\ndefaulters is going to be key to our own survival as a\\ni\\nH Corporation. N-318 is approved as proposed.”\\nOne cannot have any quarrel with the noting of the\\nManaging Director that the best interest of the H.P.F.C. was to\\nrecover the amount due from the defaulters. However, here we\\nare concerned with a case where the defaulting Unit had already\\ndeposited Rs.18.00 lacs. On the other hand along with the offer\\nof respondent No.2, which as we have already observed above,\\nwas managed through the back-door, only Rs.10.00 lacs was\\ndeposited. On 21st May, 2008, the proposal was approved and\\non the same date, the acceptance letter was issued. Here the\\nsituation becomes murkier. As noted above, till this date no final\\ndecision had been taken by the Corporation on the offer of\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 13 -\\nrespondent No.2. It was still to be decided whether other bidd.ers\\nP\\nwere to be called or whether the petitioner-loanee was to be\\n.\\ngiven another opportunity to pay the loan amount.\\nH\\nAll these matters were still under consideration and the\\ndecision was taken by the Managing Dirfector on 21st May, 2008\\no\\nonly. The acceptance letter was prepared on the same date and\\nwas addressed to both S/Sht. K.D. Sharma and R.P. Singh at\\nr\\ntheir addresses at Una. However, Shri R.P. Singh was obviously\\nu\\npresent in the Corporation premises since he received the letter\\no\\nby hand on 21st May, 2008 itself. Not only did he receive the\\nC\\nletter, but he also deposited Rs.55.00 lacs with the Corporation\\non the same date. Rs.55.00 lacs is a huge sum of money which\\nh\\nis not carried like loose change in the pocket. Interestingly, the\\ng\\nletter dated 21st May, 2008 permits these persons to deposit the\\ni\\nH balance amount of Rs.55.00 lacs within one month, but this\\namount was deposited in cash on the same date. It is apparent\\nthat Sh. R.P. Singh was aware that the order is going to be\\npassed in his favour otherwise he would not have carried such a\\nhuge amount in cash. On the same date, i.e. on 21st May, 2008,\\nShri R.P. Singh also wrote a letter to the Managing Director that\\nhe has deposited the balance amount and therefore, the\\npossession of the Unit be handed over to him. Again on 21st\\nMay, 2008 itself a letter was addressed to the Assistant General\\nManager, HPFC branch office at Dharamshala by the AGM\\n(LNT) of the Corporation directing him to hand over the\\npossession of the sold assets to Shri K.D. Sharma and Shri R.P.\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 14 -\\nSingh. A copy of this letter was also handed over to Shri R..P.\\nP\\nSingh. Thereafter on 23rd May, 2008, a FAX in this behalf was\\n.\\nagain sent to the Assistant General Manager, Dharamshala who\\nH\\non 23rd May, 2008 itself came from Dharamshala to Una and\\ndelivered the possession of the prfoperty in question to\\no\\nrespondent No.2.\\nWhat was the reason, twhy the H.P.F.C. had to proceed in\\nr\\nsuch a unholy hurry in the present case? This question has not\\nu\\nbeen answered by the Corporation. However, the reason behind\\no\\nthis unholy hurry is apparent because the petitioner was also in\\nC\\nthe meantime trying to wield his influence to force the\\nCorporation to consider his request.\\nh\\nThe petitioner had sent letters to the Hon’ble Chief\\ng\\nMinister of the State and also met certain Members of the\\ni\\nH Legislative Assembly, who in turn had met the Managing Director\\non 24.5.2008 at 1.00 P.M. as is apparent from the perusal of the\\nnote on the said letter made by the Managing Director. It is\\napparent that with an intention to make the efforts of the\\npetitioner redundant, the Corporation acted in a hot-haste\\nmanner.\\nFor a Unit, which had not been sold for the last two years\\nand for which fresh negotiations were held on 14th May, 2008,\\nwhat was the reason for permitting respondent No.2 to enter\\nfrom the back-door on 16th May, 2008 and then finalize the deal\\nwithin 5 days without giving any opportunity either to the\\npetitioner or to the original bidders and thereafter the possession\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 15 -\\nwas handed over within 2 days. We do not see such urgenc.y in\\nP\\nother matters of the H.P.F.C. including the Court cases of the\\n.\\nH.P.F.C. where normally long adjournments are asked for.\\nH\\nThe entire facts narrated by us in detail above clearly\\nshow that somebody in the Corporationf was hand in glove with\\no\\nrespondent No.2. He was intimated about the offer made on 14th\\nMay, 2008, which led the restpondent No.2 to make a back-door\\nr\\nentry and offer a higher amount on 16th May, 2008. Despite the\\nu\\npetitioner depositing Rs.18.00 lacs, the Corporation did not deem\\no\\nit fit to even call him for discussions or negotiations. If the\\nC\\nCorporation could give one month’s time to respondent No.2 to\\ndeposit the balance amount, reasonableness and fair play\\nh\\nrequired that similar time should have been given to the\\ng\\npetitioner to pay the defaulting amount.\\ni\\nH We cannot ignore the fact that it is the petitioner who set-\\nup the Unit. He may be a chronic defaulter, but it is through his\\nefforts that the Unit was set-up. The total outstanding amount of\\nthe Unit was Rs.66,52,394/- as worked out by the Corporation\\nand the petitioner deposited Rs.18.00 lacs. On 24th May, 2008,\\nthe petitioner deposited another amount of Rs.6.00 lacs and thus\\nhe deposited Rs.24.00 lacs in total. The petitioner also deposited\\nanother sum of Rs.21.00 lacs by way of drafts somewhere\\naround 19.6.2008. This was not a small amount. The best course\\nfor the Corporation was to have given the petitioner some time to\\nliquidate his liability before finalizing the deal with respondent\\nNo.2.\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 16 -\\nDuring the course of the proceedings, the petitioner ha.s in\\nP\\nfact obtained an offer of Rs.1,30.00 crores from Sh.

It is also contended that the price of the\\nproperty has risen during this period. We cannot accept this\\ncontention. This court can take judicial notice of the fact that\\nduring this period of economic recession, the property prices\\nhave fallen all over the country including the State of Himachal\\nPradesh. The offer of Rs.1.30 crores made by S/Shri Puran\\nChand Juneja and Shyam Lal is double the amount offered by\\nthe petitioner. The difference is so large that it leaves no doubt in\\nour minds that the offer made by respondent No.2 is much below\\nthe market value of the property.

And others [(2005) 4 Supreme Co.urt\\nP\\nCases 456].\\n.\\nWe need not to refer all these judgments in detail since\\nH\\nafter consideration of the entire law, the apex Court in\\nKarnataka State Industrial Investmfent & Development\\no\\nCorporation Ltd. has summarize the legal principles as follows:-\\n“19. From the aforesaitd, the legal principles that emerge\\nr\\nare:-\\nu\\n(i) The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction\\no\\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution does not\\nC\\nsit as an appellate authority over the acts and\\ndeeds of the Financial Corporation and seek\\nh\\nto correct them. The doctrine of fairness does\\ng\\nnot convert the writ courts into appellate\\ni\\nH authorities over administrative authorities.\\n(ii) In a matter between the Corporation and its\\ndebtor, a writ court has no say except in two\\nsituations:\\n(a) there is a statutory violation on the part of\\nthe Corporation, or\\n(b) where the Corporation acts unfairly i.e.\\nunreasonably.\\n(iii) In commercial matters, the courts should not\\nrisk their judgments for the judgments of the\\nbodies to which that task is assigned.\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 19 -\\n(iv) Unless the action of the Financial Corpora.tion\\nP\\nis mala fide, even a wrong decision taken by it\\n.\\nis not open to challenge. It is not for the courts\\nH\\nor a third party to substitute its decision,\\nhowever, more prufdent, commercial or\\no\\nbusinesslike it may be, for the decision of the\\nFinancial tCorporation. Hence, whatever the\\nr\\nwisdom (or the lack of it) of the conduct of the\\nu\\nCorporation, the same cannot be assailed for\\no\\nmaking the Corporation liable.\\nC\\n(v) In the matter of sale of public property, the\\ndominant consideration is to secure the best\\nh\\nprice for the property to be sold and this could\\ng\\nbe achieved only when there is maximum\\ni\\nH public participation in the process of sale and\\nevery body has an opportunity of making an\\noffer.\\n(vi) Public auction is not the only mode to secure\\nthe best price by inviting maximum public\\nparticipation, tender and negotiation could\\nalso be adopted.\\n(vii) The Financial Corporation is always expected\\nto try and realize the maximum sale price by\\nselling the assets by following a procedure\\nwhich is transparent and acceptable, after due\\npublicity, wherever possible and if any reason\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 20 -\\nis indicated or cause shown for the defa.ult,\\nP\\nthe same has to be considered in its proper\\n.\\nperspective and a conscious decision has to\\nH\\nbe taken as to whether action under Section\\n29 of the Act is cfall for. Thereafter, the\\no\\nmodalities for disposal of the seized unit have\\nto be workted out.\\nr\\n(viii) Fairness cannot be a one-way street. The\\nu\\nfairness required of the Financial\\no\\nCorporations cannot be carried to the extent\\nC\\nof disabling them from recovering what is due\\nto them. While not insisting upon the borrower\\nh\\nto honour the commitments undertaken by\\ng\\nhim, the Financial Corporation alone cannot\\ni\\nH be shackled hand and foot in the name of\\nfairness.\\n(ix) Reasonableness is to be tested against the\\ndominant consideration to secure the best\\nprice.”\\nThe judgment relied upon by the respondent No.2 itself\\nclearly lays down that the writ court can interfere where the\\nCorporation acts unfairly or unreasonably. We have no doubt in\\nour mind that the Corporation acted unfairly and unreasonably\\nfirstly, by not giving an opportunity to the earlier two bidders to\\nbetter their offers and secondly by not holding any negotiation\\nwith the petitioner after he had deposited a huge amount of\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 21 -\\nRs.18.00 lacs before the offer of respondent No.2 had b.een\\nP\\naccepted.\\n.\\nWe are also of the view that though mala fides against a\\nH\\nparticular person may not have been proved, it is apparent, as\\nheld by us above, that some highlyf placed official of the\\no\\nCorporation was hand in glove with respondent No.2. This is\\napparent because respondetnt No.2 was allowed to negotiate\\nr\\nafter 14th May, 2008. The dates have been fudged by the\\nu\\nCorporation and it is made to appear that the respondent No.2\\no\\nmade the offer on 15th May, 2008, whereas it is apparent that\\nC\\nonly the application form was sold on 15th May, 2008, but the\\nsame was received in the office of the Corporation only on 16th\\nh\\nMay, 2008. It is more than apparent that the respondent No.2\\ng\\nwas aware of the offers made by the earlier bidders. The\\ni\\nH respondent No.2 was aware of what was happening inside the\\nCorporation since he was ready with Rs.55.00 lacs in cash even\\nbefore his offer had been accepted. It is apparent that somebody\\nin the Corporation had assured him that his offer would be\\naccepted and therefore despite the fact the respondent No2. was\\ngiven time of 30 days to deposit the amount, this huge sum of\\nmoney was deposited, that too in cash, on 21st May, 2008 itself.\\nIt is indeed surprising that the respondent No.2 could manage to\\ndeposit Rs.65.00 lacs in cash within a period of five days. No\\nsource of these funds has been disclosed till date. In view of the\\naforesaid facts, we are of the considered opinion that legal mala\\nfides are writ large on the canvas of this case.\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:17:48 :::CIS2009:HHC:3587-DB\\n- 22 -\\nThe apex Court has also held that in the matter of sal.e of\\nP\\npublic property the dominant consideration is to secure the best\\n.\\nprice of the property. The offer of the respondent No.2 was only\\nH\\nRs.65.00 lacs, whereas M/s Puran Chand Juneja and Shyam Lal\\nhave offered Rs.1.30 crores. Thus, ift is apparent that the\\no\\ndecision of the Corporation is totally unreasonable, arbitrary and\\nmala fide. t\\nr\\nIn view of the above discussion, we allow the writ petition\\nu\\nand quash the decision of the Corporation taken on 21st May,\\no\\n2008 to sell the property to respondent No.2. We further issue a\\nC\\ndirection directing the respondent No.2 to return the possession\\nof the property to the H.P.F.C.\\nh\\nAccording to the calculations of the H.P.F.C. itself, the\\ng\\ntotal amount payable by the petitioner to the Corporation was\\ni\\nH Rs.73,15,490/-. This amount is not admitted to be correct by the\\npetitioner. We cannot decide this matter in these proceedings.\\nAn amount of Rs.10.00 lacs has been deposited by M/s Puran\\nChand Juneja and Shyam Lal in this court. This amount along\\nwith the interest accrued there upon shall be remitted to the\\nH.P.F.C. by depositing the same in its bank account, the details\\nwhereof will be furnished by H.P.F.C. to the Registry within one\\nweek from today.

However, the Sec.tional Officers\\nH\\nworking in Conservation wing were not granted this pay scale. The\\nSectional Officers filed a writ petitions in the Hon ’ble Punjab and Haryana\\nf\\nHigh Court bearing No. 11511/93 and 12785/93. Their case, in nutshell,\\no\\nwas that their post was comparable with post of Conservation\\nInspectors/Agriculture Inspectorts/Soil Survey Assistants/Research\\nr\\nAssistants designated as Soil Conservation Officer and they were also\\nu\\nentitled to revised pay scale at par with them. The stand of the Punjab\\no\\nGovernment before the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court was that\\nC\\nthe qualification for the appointment to the post of Soil Conservation\\nOfficer is different vis-à-vis the category of the petitioners.

Soil Survey Assistants/\\nH\\nResearch Assistants.\\nIn sequel to the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Punjab and\\nHaryana High Court on 14.12.1995, the State of Punjab took a conscious\\ndecision on 13.1.1997 (Annexure A-12). The text of letter dated 13.1.1997\\nreads thus:\\n“In compliance with the orders in Civil Writ Petition No.\\n11571, 12785, 7809, 8687, 9499 of 1993 and L.P.A’s No.\\n581, 584 to 587 of 1996 passed by the Hon’ble Punjab\\nand Haryana High Court the Governor of Punjab is\\npleased to grant revised pay scales of Sectional Officers\\n(now known as Junior Engineers) as under:\\nDate from which scale Revised Pay Scale (iv)\\nis to be revised\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:18:15 :::CIS2009:HHC:7288\\n3\\n1.1.1986 2000-3500\\n1.1.1991 2200-4000 Scale at the time\\n.\\nof entry into service.\\nP\\n3000-4500 After eight years\\nof service .\\nH\\n3700-5300 After 18 years of\\nservice.\\n1.

In other words, the judgment rendered by\\nthe Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court had attained finality.\\nIt is not disputed that the State of Himachal Pradesh adopts the\\npay scales of the corresponding categories of employees serving in the\\nState of Punjab for its own employees. The State Government took a\\nconscious decision on the basis of the letter dated 13.1.1997 issued by\\nthe State of Punjab vide Annexure A-2 on 31.12.1997. The text of letter\\ndated 31.12.1997 reads thus:\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:18:15 :::CIS2009:HHC:7288\\n4\\n“I am directed to refer to your letter No. Agr.H (1) B.5-\\n11/79-Vol.II dated the 10th December, 1997 on the\\n.\\nsubject cited above and to convey the approval of the\\nP\\nGovernment for the grant of revised pay scales to the\\nJunior Engineers in the Agriculture Depa.rtment on the\\nH\\nbasis of Punjab pattern with effect from 1.1.1991 as\\nunder:\\nDate from which Revised pay scale (Rs.)\\nf\\nscale is to be\\no\\nrevised\\n1.1.1986 2000-3500\\nt\\n1.1.1991 (i) 2200-4000 scale at the time of\\nr\\nentry into service.\\nu\\n(ii) 3000-4500 After eight years\\no of service.\\n(iii) 3700-5300 After 18 years of\\nC\\nservice.\\n2.

It is evident from para 2 of\\nthe letter dated 31.12.1997 that the revision of the pay scale from Rs.\\n2000-3500 as indicated above was subject to the outcome received from\\nthe Punjab Government with reference to letter dated 13.1.1997. The\\npetitioners were released these pay scales. In fact the petitioners were\\nalso granted the master pay scales vide letter dated 9.1.1998. However,\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:18:15 :::CIS2009:HHC:7288\\n5\\nthe Director of Agriculture i.e. respondent No.2 on 10.6.2004 issued fresh\\norder whereby the pay scale of Rs. 3000-4500/3700-5300 earlier allowed\\n.\\nP\\nto the Extra Assistant Engineers/Junior Engineers after 1.1.1996 was\\nwithdrawn.

He further submitted that once a conscious\\ndecision has been taken by the State Government on 31.12.1997 on the\\nbasis of letter dated 13.1.1997, the same could not be withdrawn by the\\nDirector of Agriculture on 10.6.2004. In other words his submission was\\nthat the decision taken by the State Government could not be rendered\\notiose by the Director of Agriculture as he was not competent authority to\\ndo so. He has also relied upon letters dated 30.12.2002, 5.2.2004 and\\n7.7.2004.\\nMr. R.K.

They had been working in\\nthese schemes/works and extension activities. I t is not in dispute that in\\nf\\nthe matter of revision of pay scales, the State of Himachal Pradesh adopts\\no\\nthe pattern of the corresponding post made applicable in the State of\\nPunjab. It is evident that the Setctional Officers in the State of Punjab\\nr\\nwere not granted the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500, but their pay was\\nu\\nrevised from Rs. 700-1200 to 1800-3200 on 18.7.1994. The\\no\\ncorresponding posts of Agriculture Inspectors/Soil Conservation\\nC\\nInspectors/Research Assistants etc. were re-designated as Soil\\nConserv ation Officers. This category was granted three tier pay scales.\\nh\\nThe category of Sectional Officers approached the Punjab and Haryana\\ng\\nHigh Court for the redressal of their grievances. The Punjab and Haryana\\niHigh Court allowed the writ petition preferred by the Sectional Officers on\\nH\\n14.12.1995. A conscious decision was taken by the State of Punjab\\nwhereby also allowed the three tier pay scales on the basis of letter dated\\n13.1.1997 to the Sectional Officers. The State of Punjab had also\\npreferred an SLP against the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High\\nCourt, which was dismissed by the Apex Court on 19.3.1997.\\nThe State of Himachal Pradesh has also taken a conscious\\ndecision on 31.12.1997 whereby three tier pay scales were granted to the\\ncategory of the petitioners. There was a rider in letter dated 31.12.1997\\nthat the pay revision of the pay scales was made subject to the outcome\\nof letter dated 13.1.1997. It has also been noted that as far as letter dated\\n13.1.1997 is concerned it was made subject to the outcome of further\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:18:15 :::CIS2009:HHC:7288\\n7\\nappeal preferred against the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High\\nCourt.

Thus, the decision taken was in conformity with law\\nand more particularly in tune with letter dated 13.1.1997. It .will also be apt\\nH\\nat this stage to take note of order dated 30.12.2002 issued by the State of\\nPunjab which reads thus:\\nf\\n“The Sectional Officers (Now Junior Engineers) of the\\no\\nSoil Conservation Department were allowed pay party\\nand were treated at par as in the case of Soil\\nt\\nConservation Officers (Now Agriculture Inspectors) vide\\nr\\nthis Department memo No. 4/42/93-1-Agri-III/614 dated\\nu\\n13.4.1997.\\n2.

Accordingly it is held that the petitioners who\\nwere working in the Soil Conservation Branch are entitled to get parity with\\ni\\nH\\nSectional Officers working in the State of Punjab now re-designated as\\nSoil Conservation Officers.\\nThe stand of the respondent-State is that the petitioners are not\\ndischarging the same and similar duties which are being discharged by\\nthe Officers i.e. Sectional Officers now re-designated as Soil Conservation\\nOfficers in the State of Punjab. Its further stand is that the qualifications of\\nthe Junior Engineers prescribed in the State of Himachal Pradesh are\\ndifferent from the one provided in the State of Punjab in the Recruitment\\nand Promotion Rules for the post of Junior Engineer. It has also been\\ntaken note of by the Court that the petitioners are also working in the soil\\nconservation wing and are taking care of soil schemes/works and\\nextension activities with Block Development Officers. A similar plea was\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:18:15 :::CIS2009:HHC:7288\\n9\\nalso raised before the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court whereby it\\nwas stated that the works of civil engineering nature are got executed\\n.\\nP\\nthrough the Sectional Officers and the rest of the departmental works are\\ngot done through the Agricultural Inspectors etc. This ple.a was repelled\\nH\\nby the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Consequently, it is held that the\\npetitioners were discharging the same and similar duties which were being\\nf\\ndischarged by their counterparts in the Conservation Department of\\no\\nPunjab.\\nThe other plea raised by tthe learned Senior Additional Advocate\\nr\\nGeneral is that the petitioners have been granted the pay scales of the\\nu\\npost of Junior Engineer which has been paid to all the Junior Engineers\\no\\nworking in other departments on the basis of notification dated 19.5.1998.\\nC\\nThis similar plea was also raised before the Punjab and Haryana High\\nCourt b ut the same was also repelled by the Punjab and Haryana High\\nh\\nCourt. It appears from the pleadings of the parties that in the State of\\ng\\nPunjab after revising the pay scales of Sectional Officers, their\\niqualifications were altered, however, the same were later on deleted and\\nH\\nearlier qualifications were restored.

The petitioner in sequel to letter dated 21.4.2006\\nsupplied all the necessary documents i.e. certificate issued by the Pradhan,\\nf\\nGram Panchayat, Harnoda, copy of the Ration Card and copy of Pariwar\\no\\nRegister. He also made representation to respondent No.2 on 4.3.2008.\\nThe case of the petitioner was not considered for inclusion of his name in\\nt\\nr\\nthe list of houseless persons. The case of the respondent is that the\\nu\\npetitioner is not eligible to be included in the list of houseless persons, as\\no\\nper Scheme Ext.P1 called “The Resettlement and Rehabilitation of the\\nC\\nOustees of Kol Dam Hydro Electric Project (grant of land and other\\nbenefits) Scheme, 1999”.\\nh\\nMs. Radhika Gautam, Advocate has strenuously argued that the\\ncasge of the petitioner is fully covered under the Scheme prepared by the\\nState of Himachal Pradesh and the National Thermal Power Corporation for\\ni\\nH\\nrehabilitation and resettlement. She further contended that the petitioner\\nhad constructed house in village Chamyon and his name has already been\\nrecorded in the Pariwar Register in the Gram Panchayat, Harnoda under\\nwhose jurisdiction the village Chamyon falls.\\nThe learned Additional Advocate General has argued that the\\npetitioner is not eligible as per the scheme.

Clause 2.1.1 of the Scheme reads thus:\\no\\n“2.1.1 Resettlement Grant:\\nEach oustee family which will be rendered houseless on\\nt\\naccount of acquisition of land/house for the KOL DAM\\nr\\nProject shall be entitled to:\\nu\\na. A compensation of Rs. 60,000/- in the form of\\nhousoeless grant, and\\nb.

An ‘oustee’ means a land owner who has been\\ndeprived of his house or land or both on account of acquisition\\nproceedings/private negotiations in connection with the construction of Kol\\nDam Project and entitled to compensation of lieu thereof and includes his\\nsuccessors in interest.\\nIt is not disputed by the parties that the petitioner’s land as well as\\nhouse was acquired for the construction of Kol Dam Hydro Electric Project.\\nThe petitioner has made several representations, as noticed above. He\\nwas called upon to substantiate his claim by the Deputy Commissioner,\\nBilaspur vide communication dated 21.4.2006.

It isP clear\\nfrom the ration card that the name of the petitioner has been shown in\\n.\\nH\\nvillage Chamyon. It is evident from the copy of the Pariwar register that the\\npetitioner is a resident of village Chamyon and his name was included in\\nf\\nthe Panchayat register of Gram Panchayat, Harnoda since August 2000.\\no\\nThe respondents No. 1 & 2 have categorically admitted in their reply\\nthat the land and house of the petitioner was acquired for construction of\\nt\\nr\\nKol Dam Hydro Electric Project. The only reason assigned for not-granting\\nu\\nthe benefit to the petitioner as per the report of the Tehsildar dated\\no\\n19.12.2005 is that the acquired house was non-residential. It has also\\nC\\ncome in the report of the Tehsildar that he owns a residential house in Up-\\nmuhal Kosrian and a shop in main market.\\nh\\nThe house of the petitioner is situated in village Chamyon and the\\nsamge has been acquired for construction of Kol Dam Hydro Electric Project.\\nThe petitioner is resident of village Chamyon, as per certificate issued by\\ni\\nH\\nthe Pradhan, Gram Panchayat, Harnoda, Pariwar Register and the Ration\\nCard. There was no occasion for the respondents No. 1 & 2 to get the\\ninquiry conducted from the office of the Tehsildar to substantiate whether\\nthe petitioner owns a house in any other adjoining area and the status of\\nthe house in village Chamyon. There is no reason assigned in the report\\nhow the Tehsildar had come to the conclusion that the house of the\\npetitioner situate in village Chamyon is non-residential. It appears that the\\ninquiry conducted is one-sided and the petitioner has not been associated\\nwith the same. It was necessary for the Tehsildar at least to peruse the\\nrevenue records and also to record the statements of the persons, more\\nparticularly, of the Pradhan, Gram Panchayat, Harnoda. The inquiry report\\nbeing not in accordance with law could not be given any credence while\\ndenying the benefits to the petitioners accruing under the Scheme. As far\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:19:09 :::CIS5\\nas the house and plot No. 56 mentioned in the reply is concerned, it has\\n.\\nbeen specifically mentioned in the rejoinder that the house and ploPt was\\nallotted to the father of the petitioner being an ‘Oustee” in old Bilaspur and\\n.\\nH\\nthere are 48 share holders in this plot.\\nThe respondents have misdirected themselves by relying upon the\\nf\\nreport of the Tehsildar on two vital aspects, namely, the house situated in\\no\\nvillage Chamyon was non-residential and the petitioner owns a house/plot\\nNo. 56 in Muhal Kosrian. These reasons could not constitute the basis to\\nt\\nr\\ndeny the benefit to the petitioner under the scheme.\\nu\\nIn view of the observations made above, it is evident that the house\\no\\nof the petitioner has been acquired along with his land. He has been paid\\nC\\ncompensation for the land. He has not been paid any compensation for\\nacquisition of the house as per para 2.1.1 of the Scheme. Once the\\nh\\nscheme has been framed for resettlement and rehabilitation of the persons\\nwhgose land has been acquired, they are to be given benefits provided\\nunder the Scheme. In the present case, the stance taken by the\\ni\\nH\\nrespondents is contrary to the laudable objectives of the Scheme. The\\npetitioner had been making representations since 2004.

A registered sale deed\\nf\\nwas executed with respect to the said sale on 5.8.1988. The case set up\\no\\nby the plaintiff was that he was owner in possession of the land in dispute\\nand in November, 1991, the defetndant had tried to dispossess him from\\nr\\nthe suit land. The stand of the defendant was that the plaintiff had played\\nu\\nfraud and instead of mentioning correct khasra numbers of the land in\\no\\ndispute, he had mentioned khasra numbers of some other piece of land. It\\nC\\nwas further averred that in the suit land, there are house, cowshed and an\\norchard .

Whether the Courts below could have granted a title to the\\ndefendant/respondent of a land different than the subject\\nmatter of the sale deed Ex. D-2? Could such jurisdiction\\nvest in the Civil Court for conveying the title to a property\\nwhich was never subject matter of deed of sale?\\n2.

Whether the Courts below were of the opinion that the\\nP\\nplaintiff/appellant was not competent to sell the land sold\\nto the defendant/respondent by virtue of deed. of sale Ex.D-\\nH\\n2, was not in incumbent for the Courts below to have set\\naside the deed of sale in favour of the\\ndefendant/respondent thereby holding that the\\nf\\ndefendant/respondent has no title either to the property\\no\\npurchased or qua the suit land?\\n4. Whether in absence of proper pleadings proof the plea of\\nt\\nalleged fraud and mis-representation raised by the\\nr\\ndefendant/respondent could have been taken into\\nu\\nconsideration by both the Courts below?\\n5. Whether ito was permissible for the defendant/respondent to\\nhave claimed title to the suit property, which admittedly,\\nC\\nwas never sold to the defendant/respondent merely on the\\nground that at the time of sale, possession of suit land was\\nh delivered to the defendant/respondent by the\\nplaintiff/appellant but the same was not made subject\\ng\\nmatter of the deed of sale? Further more, whether such\\nplea was impermissible to be raised by\\ni\\nH defendant/respondent who got the mutation attested on the\\nbasis of deed of sale Ex.D-2 and got entries incorporated in\\nrevenue record?\\n6. Whether there was no justification for both the Courts\\nbelow to have ignored the revenue entries existing in\\nfavour of the plaintiff/appellant qua the suit land, when the\\ntitle of the plaintiff/appellant qua the suit property was\\nnever challenged by the defendant/respondent?\\n7.

She has testified that she had\\npurchased a house, cow-shed and an orchard from the plai.ntiff. This land\\nH\\nwas shown to her by the plaintiff. She has further deposed that khasra\\nnumber which is mentioned in the registere d sale deed is at a\\nf\\nconsiderable distance of the disputed land and the same is Banjar. She\\no\\nhas further deposed that the disputed land was cultivated by one Sh. Duni\\nChand and after payment of Rst. 260/- to Duni Chand she came in\\nr\\npossession of the land in dispute. She has also referred to agreement\\nu\\nEx.D-1. In her cross-examination, she has admitted that she was present\\no\\nat the time of execution of the sale deed. She has further stated in her\\nC\\ncross-examination that at the time of registration, Khataunis were not\\nverified. She has admitted that she had not verified the khasra number\\nh\\nfrom the Patwari nor from any other person. She also deposed that\\ng\\nPatwari used to come to the spot at the time of crop inspection. She has\\nifurther deposed that half of the agreement was written by the police\\nH\\npersonnel and the remaining was written by the Pradhan. She could not\\ndisclose the khasra numbers of the land in her possession. She has also\\ndeposed that she is living in the same house in which Salig Ram used to\\nlive and the possession of cow-shed and orchard is with her.

He has signed the sale deed as a witness. He has admitted that\\n.\\nP\\nwhatever land the plaintiff has sold, it was mentioned in the sale deed and\\ndefendant Leela Devi was present on the spot. He has fu.rther admitted\\nH\\nthat whatever land was sold by the plaintiff its possession was handed\\nover to her. The sale deed Ex.D-2 is dated 5.8.19 88.\\nf\\nIt is clear from the sale deed that only khasra No. 834, 1373/1348\\no\\nhave been mentioned in it. The description of the land has been given as\\norchard, cow-shed and two storeyted slate roofed house. This sale deed\\nr\\nwas executed in the presence of defendant Leela Devi. DW-4 has signed\\nu\\nit as a witness. DW-1 has admitted that she did not get the khasra\\no\\nnumbers of the land, which is purchased, verified from the Patwari.

DW-4 has admitted, as noticed above, that whatever land\\nH\\nwas shown by the plaintiff to Leela Devi, its possession was handed over\\nto her. The learned trial court and the learned first appellate court relied\\nupon the oral evidence to discard the contents of Ex.P-1 and D-2. It is\\nclear from Ex.P-1 that the plaintiff is owner of Khasra No. 1209/828. In\\nsale deed only khasra Nos. 834 and 1373/1348 have been mentioned. It\\ncannot be presumed that the defendant was not aware of the khasra\\nnumbers mentioned in the sale deed. It was for her to get the khasra\\nnumbers verified which she as per her own statement did not verify from\\nthe Patwari. She was present at the time of execution of the sale deed.\\nThe description of the land is specifically mentioned in the sale deed i.e.\\norchard, cow-shed and two storeyed slate roofed house. If she was\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:19:49 :::CIS2008:HHC:5071\\n7\\naggrieved in any manner of wrong mentioning of khasra number in the\\nsale deed, she could have taken recourse to law by filing appropriate\\n.\\nP\\nproceedings in the court of competent jurisdiction. The trial court has\\nreturned a finding that Khasra No. 1209/828 has not been. mentioned in\\nH\\nthe sale deed and despite that the evidence led by the plaintiff has been\\ndiscarded altogether. The learned trial cou rt was swayed by the\\nf\\nstatement of defendant that the plaintiff has fraudulently incorporated\\no\\nkhasra No. 834 and 1373/1348 in the sale deed though in fact khasra No.\\n1209/828 was sold to her. Both thte learned courts below have relied upon\\nr\\nagreement Ex.D-1 and Ex.DW-4/A while dismissing the suit of the plaintiff.\\nu\\nThese agreements could not have been taken into consideration till the\\no\\nvalidity of sale deed Ex.D-2 dated 5.8.1988 was not assailed specifically\\nC\\nby the defendant. The learned first appellate court has returned a finding\\nthat the plaintiff was in possession of the suit land. However, the appeal\\nh\\nhas been dismissed on the ground that there was no occasion for him to\\ng\\nfile a civil suit. According to the learned first appellate court, it was filed to\\nicover up the wrong mentioning of khasra numbers in the sale deed. The\\nH\\nsale deed is dated 5.8.1988. A man of ordinary prudence would have\\ndefinitely challenged the alleged wrong mentioning of khasra numbers in\\nthe sale deed if he or she was aggrieved in any manner. The fact of the\\nmatter is that till date the validity of the sale deed dated 5.8.1988 has not\\nbeen assailed by the defendant. The learned courts below have also\\ntaken into consideration that Khasra No. 1373/1348 was granted to the\\nplaintiff as Nautor in the year 1985 and the same could not be sold to the\\ndefendant in the year 1988. In the sale deed Khasra No. 1373/1348 has\\nbeen specifically mentioned. In case the land in dispute which has been\\nsold as per Ex.D-2 is a Nautor land, the same is liable to be transferred\\nback to the plaintiff, however, the Court is of the opinion that the learned\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:19:49 :::CIS2008:HHC:5071\\n8\\ncourts below have unnecessarily raked up the issue of Nautor land. If the\\nreasoning of both the courts below is taken to its logical end, the\\n.\\nP\\ndefendant would have been divested of her land as per Ex.D-2. It is also\\nnot disputed by the parties that on the basis of sale de.ed Ex.D-2, the\\nH\\nmutation was also attested in the name of the defendant meaning thereby\\nthat the defendant knew and was satisfied w ith the khasra numbers\\nf\\nmentioned in the sale deed.\\no\\nIn view of the observations made hereinabove, it is evident that\\nboth the courts below have mis-aptpreciated and mis-construed the oral as\\nr\\nwell as documentary evidence. Both the learned courts below should\\nu\\nhave been alive to the situation that till the validity of the sale deed dated\\no\\n5.8.1988 was not under cloud, the same was to be given effect to.

The respondent herein, who shall hereinafter be\\nreferred to as the ‘original applicant’, was at the relevant time\\nworking as ‘Gramin Dak Sewak’ in Branch Post office Fozal,\\nDistrict Kullu, H.P. In order to give a fillip to the business of the\\nPostal Department, routine letters/circulars were issued by the\\n1\\nWhether reporters of the local papers may be allowed to see the judgment? yes.\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:10 :::CIS2014:HHC:3456-DB\\n2\\ndepartment to its employees, including the original applica.nt.\\nP\\nHowever, he, instead of carrying out the directions contained in\\n.\\nthose orders took an offence and wrote to theH departmental\\nauthorities challenging their authority to issue such letters to\\nf\\nhim. He even did not stop at that end and instead issued a\\no\\nlegal notice as well to his superiors.\\nt\\n3. Against the foregoing background, departmental\\nr\\nu\\naction was initiated against the original applicant leading to\\no\\nholding of an inquiry against him which culminated into\\nC\\nsubmission of a report indicting him, pursuant to which, he was\\nultimate ly removed from employment without entailing\\nh\\ndisqualification for future employment. The department appeal\\ng\\nfiled by him was dismissed.\\ni\\nH 4. Being aggrieved, he carried the matter to CAT\\nwhich passed the aforesaid order dated 22.11.2010, operative\\npart whereof reads as under:-\\n“In view of the above position, the impugned order of\\npunishment dated 30.6.08 (Annexure A-5) and the\\nappellate order dated 13.7.09 (Annexure A-7) are\\nquashed and set aside and the matter is remitted to\\nrespondent No.3 to consider the matter afresh and\\nimpose some other lesser punishment other than\\ndismissal or removal, if need be after affording him an\\nopportunity of being heard. This exercise may be\\ncompleted within a period of three months from the date\\nof receipt of a certified copy of this order.”\\n5. On a bare perusal of the order passed by CAT, it is\\napparent that it exceeds the limit of judicial intervention\\nwarranted in such cases. It is settled by now that though the\\ncourt has power to scrutinize the procedural process adopted\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:10 :::CIS2014:HHC:3456-DB\\n3\\nby the authority while conducting departmental proceedi.ngs\\nP\\nagainst its employees, it cannot substitute the punishment\\n.\\nimposed upon the delinquent by importing its oHwn will in the\\nmatter. It is further settled that in a case where the conscience\\nf\\nof the court is shocked keeping in view the misconduct\\no\\nestablished against the delinquent and the quantum of\\nt\\npunishment imposed upon him, it can always issue directions to\\nr\\nu\\nthe disciplinary authority to reconsider the matter in the light of\\no\\nsuch proportionality between the misconduct and punishment\\nC\\nrequired for the same, as has been held by this court in a\\nDivision Bench judgment in Kailash Chand Sharma Vs. State\\nh\\nof H.P. & another, Latest HLJ 2011 (HP) 1025, vide paras 12\\ng\\nto 14, which are as under:-\\ni\\nH “12. It is a settled proposition of law that scope of\\njudicial review in the matters concerning departmental\\nproceedings and the resultant penalty/punishment is\\nvery limited and restricted to exceptional cases, as in\\nthe present case. The petitioner was indicted\\nconsequent upon enquiry proceedings conducted in\\naccordance with rules. However, in the peculiar facts\\nand circumstances of the present case when the\\nrecords unerringly go to show that the petitioner was in\\nfact ailing during the relevant period, a part whereof\\nfrom 31.05.1985 to 25.05.1986, which comes to just less\\nthan one year, is also covered under medical certificate,\\nAnnexure P-16, issued by a Medical Board headed by\\nChief Medical Officer, Shimla, District Shimla, the\\npenalty of removal from service imposed upon the\\npetitioner by the disciplinary authority is on the face of it\\ngrossly disproportionate to the misconduct established\\nagainst the petitioner and in a way shocks the judicial\\nconscience, as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme\\nCourt in Dev Singh vs. Punjab Tourism Development\\nCorporation Ltd. and another, (2003) 8 Supreme Court\\nCases 9 wherein it has been held as under vide para 6 of\\nthe judgment:\\n“A perusal of the above judgments clearly shows\\nthat a court sitting in appeal against a punishment\\nimposed in the disciplinary proceedings will not\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:10 :::CIS2014:HHC:3456-DB\\n4\\nnormally substitute its own conclusion .on\\npenalty, however, if the punishment imposPed by\\nthe disciplinary authority or the appellate\\nauthority shocks the conscience of the court, then\\n.\\nthe court would appropriately mould the relief\\nH\\neither by directing the disciplinary/appropriate\\nauthority to reconsider the penalty imposed or to\\nshorten the litigation it may make an exception in\\nrare cases and impose appropriate punishment\\nf\\nwith cogent reasons in support thereof. It is also\\no\\nclear from the above noted judgments of this\\nCourt, if the punishment imposed by the\\ndisciplinary autho rity is totally disproportionate to\\nthe miscondutct proved against the delinquent\\nofficer, then the court would interfere in such a\\nr\\ncase.”\\nu\\n13. To the similar effect is the proposition of law\\npropounded by the Hon'ble Apex Court in State of\\no\\nMeghalaya and others vs. Mecken Singh N. Marak,\\n(2008) 7 Supreme Court Cases 580, paras 14 and 15,\\nC\\nbeing relevant, are extracted below:\\n“14. In the matter of imposition of sentence, the\\nscope for interference is very limited and\\nh\\nrestricted to exceptional cases. The jurisdiction of\\nthe High Court, to interfere with the quantum of\\ng punishment is limited and cannot be exercised\\nwithout sufficient reasons. The High Court,\\ni although has jurisdiction in appropriate case, to\\nconsider the question in regard to the quantum of\\nH\\npunishment, but it has a limited role to play. It is\\nnow well settled that the High Courts, in exercise\\nof powers under Article 226, do not interfere with\\nthe quantum of punishment unless there exist\\nsufficient reasons therefor. The punishment\\nimposed by the disciplinary authority or the\\nappellate authority unless shocking to the\\nconscience of the court, cannot be subjected to\\njudicial review. In the impugned order of the High\\nCourt no reasons whatsoever have been indicated\\nas to why the punishment was considered\\ndisproportionate. Failure to give reasons amounts\\nto denial of justice. The mere statement that it is\\ndisproportionate would not suffice.\\n15. While considering the question of\\nproportionality of sentence imposed on a\\ndelinquent at the conclusion of departmental\\nenquiry, the court should also take into\\nconsideration, the mental set-up of the\\ndelinquent, the type of duty to be performed by\\nhim and similar relevant circumstances which go\\ninto the decision-making process. If the charged\\nemployee holds the position of trust where\\nhonesty and integrity are inbuilt requirements of\\nfunctioning, it would not be proper to deal with\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:10 :::CIS2014:HHC:3456-DB\\n5\\nthe matter leniently. Misconduct, in such ca.ses\\nhas to be dealt with iron hands.” P\\n14. In view of the above, the petition succeeds partly\\n.\\nand is allowed in part. Consequently, the impugned\\nH\\norder dated 16.06.1988, Annexure P-8, as upheld in\\nappeal, vide order dated 29.10.2010, Annexure P-14, is\\nquashed with a direction to the respondents/competent\\nauthority to reconsider the matter with regard to\\nf\\nquantum of penalty upon the petitioner taking into\\no\\nconsideration the proportionality between the\\nmisconduct established against the petitioner and the\\npunishment to be impo sed upon him for the same in the\\nlight of the law laid tdown by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\\nthe judgments referred to hereinabove and the\\nr\\nobservations made in this judgment and take a final\\ndecision in theu matter within three months from the date\\nof production of copy of this judgment by the petitioner\\nafter affording an opportunity of being heard to him, if\\no\\nso desired.”\\nC\\n6. In view of the above, the impugned order of CAT\\ndated 2 2.11.2010, Annexure P-3, is quashed to the extent it\\nh\\namounts to issuance of a direction to the respondents to hand\\ng\\nout a particular punishment to the original applicant and as a\\ni\\nH result is modified with a direction to the respondents/competent\\nauthority to reconsider the matter regarding imposition of\\npunishment to the original applicant keeping in view the\\nproportionality between the misconduct proved against him and\\nappropriate punishment required to be imposed upon him\\nkeeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the\\npresent case, such as the advanced age of the original\\napplicant, which right now is stated to be 60 years, the nature of\\nhis employment which is not permanent and the submission\\nthat he is the sole bread earning member in the family\\nbelonging to poor strata of society.\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:10 :::CIS2014:HHC:3456-DB\\n6\\n7.

The vehicle was being\\n.\\ndriven by the accused on a public highway inH a rash and\\nnegligent manner and due to the accident the complainant\\nf\\nsuffered injuries. The accused carried the complainant to the\\no\\nDistrict hospital at Reckong Peo for treatment. Based on the\\ncomplaint lodged with the politce, FIR No. 61/96 (Ext.PW-6/A),\\nr\\ndated 6.11.1996 under Sections 279, 337 & 338 IPC was\\nu\\nregistered with Police Station, Reckong Peo, Distt.

The accused was charged\\nfor the offences under Sections 279, 337 & 338 IPC, to which he\\npleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\\nIn order to prove its case the prosecution examined\\n10 witnesses and the statement of the accused under Section\\n313 Cr.PC was also recorded.\\nAppreciating the material on record, the Court below\\nfound that the prosecution had failed to prove the guilt of the\\naccused beyond reasonable doubt. Shri Swarup Singh (PW-4)\\nan occupant of the vehicle in question had deposed the version\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:36 :::CIS2008:HHC:1492\\n3\\n.\\nP\\nshowing the innocence of the accused, therefore, giving the\\n.\\nbenefit of doubt, the accused was acquitted. H\\nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and\\nf\\nperused the record.\\no\\nThe vehicle in question was got mechanically\\nexamined and found to be in at fit condition. Doctor proved the\\nr\\nMLC and also the injuries (grievous) sustained by PW-1.\\nu\\nHowever, that fact by itself is not sufficient to prove the guilt of\\no\\nthe accused. No doubt, complainant Dilli Ram (PW-1) has\\nC\\ndeposed that the accused who was driving the vehicle in\\nquestion at the relevant place and time had caused accident due\\nh\\nto which he suffered injury on his body, but however, PW-8 had\\ng\\nclearly proved the innocence of the accused .\\ni\\nH As per the version of Shri Shiv Raj (PW-8), he was\\ntravelling in the vehicle at the time and place of the occurrence\\nof the accident. According to him, PW-1 was loitering in the\\ncenter of the road. The accused who was driving the vehicle at a\\nspeed of 40-42 kms. had blown the horn but however, PW-1 had\\nnot paid any attention to it and in fact was looking at the river\\nbelow the road. The road was straight and there were lot of\\npasser byes on the road. It was only after the vehicle had\\ncrossed PW-1, the back portion of the vehicle hit the\\ncomplainant on the shoulder. The vehicle was immediately\\nstopped by the accused and the injured was taken to the\\nhospital. This only proves that the accused had not been\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:36 :::CIS2008:HHC:1492\\n4\\n.\\nP\\nnegligent in any manner and in fact had been cautious while\\n.\\ndriving the vehicle. H\\nThe version of PW-1 stands contradicted by his\\nf\\nearlier statement and also the material on record. When\\no\\nconfronted with his earlier statement made to the police at the\\ntime of accident he was standting under the tree. He clearly\\nr\\nadmitted that his earlier version is incorrect. Importantly, his\\nu\\nearlier statement stands duly signed by him. Further, there is a\\no\\nvariation in the statement of PW-1 and the site plan Ext.PW-\\nC\\n10/A with regard to the place where he was standing on the road\\nat the time of the occurrence of the accident.\\nh\\nIn order to constitute an offence under Section 279\\ng\\nIPC, it is necessarily required to be proved that the accused at\\ni\\nH the time and place of the occurrence of the accident was driving\\nthe vehicle on a public highway in a manner which would\\nendanger the safety of the passer byes.\\nI would agree with the following principles of law\\nculled out by the Court below from various judicial\\npronouncements of the Apex Court :-\\n“The prosecution has to establish beyond all\\nreasonable doubts that accused at the time and place\\nof occurrence was driving his vehicle in such a\\nmanner from which it can be safely said that he\\nacted with consciousness of risk that evil-\\nconsequences, were likely to follow therefrom.\\nNegligence means breach of duty caused by omission\\nto do something which a reasonable man guided by\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:36 :::CIS2008:HHC:1492\\n5\\n.\\nP\\nthose considerations which ordinarily regulate\\n.\\nconduct of human affairs would do or doing\\nH\\nsomething which a prudent and reasonable man\\nwould not do.\\nf\\nThere is a duty on eovery user of the road to\\nmake a reasonable use of it for the purpose of\\npassing along it and to allow others to do so also. A\\nt\\nperson driving a rmotor-car has a right to expect that\\nthe persons nuegligently loitering on the road would\\nmake way for him especially when he has seen that\\no\\nthey were aware of his approach. He has the right to\\nassCume that they would get out of the way when they\\nsaw him and ignore their signals to stop. Motorists\\nare not the only persons who owe a duty of care;\\nh\\nothers also have a responsibility and must conform to\\ng\\nthe ordinary usage of the road.\\ni In determining whether a person is negligent\\nH\\nor rash, the standard of reasonable care is that which\\nis reasonably to be demanded in the circumstances.\\nThe term ‘negligence’ indicates want of care; it is\\nfailure to exercise a care demanded by the\\ncircumstances. The standard of care ordinarily would\\nbe in that of a prudent and reasonable man observing\\nin a set of circumstances, unless the case is such as\\nto require higher degree of care. The driver must be\\nable to pull up within limits of vision, but each case\\nmust depend upon its own circumstances. If there is\\nno danger to the public outside the vehicle, who are\\nusing the road, no offence under Section 279 IPC is\\ncommitted. Although, driver on the pubic way should\\nnot expect reasonable care from road users. He must\\nanticipate even their negligent acts which are\\nreasonably foreseeable. It is not possible to accept\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:20:36 :::CIS2008:HHC:1492\\n6\\n.\\nP\\nthat as a matter of law an extra responsibility\\n.\\ndevolves on driver for taking extra precaution to\\nH\\navoid accidents. Enough if he blows horn and travels\\nat a low speed, then the ingredie nts of offence under\\nf\\nSection 279 I.P.C. are not established. Every case of\\no\\ncollusion of the motor-car and pedestrian have to be\\njudged on its merits.”\\nt\\nr\\nIn the present case, all precaution had been taken\\nu\\nby the accused. The care and caution required to be taken by a\\no\\nprudent man had been taken. PW-1 who was not paying\\nC\\nattention to the moving traffic on the public highway got hit\\nwhen the vehicle had already crossed him. Therefore, it cannot\\nh\\nbe said that the accused committed the charged offence.\\ng\\nThe Court below has appreciated the material in its\\ni\\nH entirety.

The amount claimed by\\nthe contractor is not disputed. This payment was not paid by the HPTDC\\n.\\nP\\non the ground that the contractor had failed to give EPF clearance\\n.\\ncertificate from the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, Shimla. The\\nH\\nstand of the contractor was that his establishment does not employ 20\\nf\\nemployees or more and the numbers of employees working under him was\\no\\nless than 20 and therefore, the provisions of the Employees Provident\\nFund Act are not applicable to him. t\\nr\\nIt appears that the Provident Fund Commissioner, Shimla,\\nu\\nissued notices to the HPTDC and treated the employees of the Contractor\\no\\nto be employee of the HPTDC by applying the principle that the HPTDC\\nC\\nwas the Principal Employer. The order was passed against the HPTDC and\\nh\\nnot against the contractor.

(2003) 5 SCC 705, had interpreted the phrase\\n“public policy of India” as under:-\\n“Therefore, in our view, the phrase `Public Policy of\\nIndia' used in Section 34 in context is required to be given a\\n::: Downloaded on - 21/04/2024 11:21:20 :::CISwider meaning.

What is for public good or in puPblic\\ninterest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public\\n.\\ngood or public interest has varied from timHe to time.\\nHowever, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in\\nviolation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public\\nf\\ninterest. Such award/judgment/decisoion is likely to adversely\\naffect the administration of justice.

KESHAVA RAO\\nWRIT PETITION No.46792 of 2018\\nORDER: (Per V. Ramasubramanian, J)\\nChallenging the rejection of transitional relief in terms of\\nsections 73 and 74 of the Telagnana Goods and Services Act, 2017 (for\\nshort ‘the Act’) read with Rule 121 thereto, and a consequential\\ndemand made for the alleged excess claim of transitional relief, the\\nDealer has come up with the above writ petition.\\n2. Heard Mr. P. Anil Mukharji, learned counsel appearing for\\nthe petitioner and Mr. J. Anil Kumar, learned Special Standing\\nCounsel for the respondents.\\n3. The petitioner is engaged in the business of leasing and\\nfinancing of vehicles and equipments. They were earlier registered\\nunder the Telangana Value Added Tax Act and now registered under\\nthe Central and State GST Acts.\\n4. According to the petitioner, they had an input tax credit to the\\ntune of Rs.1,79,23,784/-, as on the date of bifurcation of the composite\\nState of Andhra Pradesh, namely, 02.06.2014. In order to deal with the\\nquestion of transfer of ITC, as between the bifurcated States that came\\ninto existence after reorganization, a circular dated 12.05.2015 was\\nissued by the commissioner of Commercial Taxes. The circular\\nprescribed that those dealers, who migrated from the State of Andhra\\nPradesh to the State of Telangana may claim Net Credit Carried3 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\nForward (NCCF) in the State to which they have migrated after the\\nappointed date. It was further stipulated that the formula shall be in\\ntune with Section 56 of the Andhra Pradesh State Reorganization Act,\\n2014.\\n5. According to the petitioner, they migrated to the State of\\nTelangana after bifurcation and the amount of total ITC available to\\ntheir credit was shown in the Web Portal of the Department as\\nRs.1,77,65,101/-.\\n6. It is the case of the petitioner that there are no provisions\\navailable in the VAT return form to show such credit and the petitioner\\ncontinued to use such credit. By June 2017, the petitioner had already\\nused credit worth Rs.33,53,485/- leaving a balance credit of\\nRs.1,43,96,486/-, as on 01.07.2017, when the State and Central GST\\nLaw came into effect.\\n7. The petitioner claims to have filed all their returns up to\\n30.06.2017 under the Telangana VAT Act, 2005.\\n8. After the GST Law came into force with effect from\\n01.07.2017, the registered dealers were made entitled under Section\\n140 of the Telangana GST Act, 2017 to take in their electronic credit\\nledgers, the amount of credit carried forward in their returns, furnished\\nunder the existing law. As per this transitional arrangement, the\\npetitioner filed TRAN-1 on 07.10.2017 under the Telangana Goods\\nand Services Tax Act, 2017 for the transfer of ITC of Rs.1,43,96,486/-\\navailable as on 30.06.2017 under the State VAT Act. But, the officials\\nattached to the office of the Assistant Commissioner (State Tax)4 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\nvisited the premises of the petitioner on 13.03.2018 purportedly for the\\nverification of TRAN-1 filed by them. Thereafter, a notice dated\\n28.05.2018 was issued advising the petitioner not to claim transitional\\ncredit and calling upon the petitioner to produce documentary\\nevidences for the transitional relief.\\n9. The petitioner submitted a reply on 07.08.2018. Without\\npassing any orders on the reply so filed, the Assistant Commissioner\\n(State Tax) issued another notice dated 05.10.2018 and the petitioner\\nagain filed a reply on 07.11.2018.\\n10. A personal hearing was conducted on 16.11.2018 and\\nthereafter an order dated 26.11.2018 was passed by the Assistant\\nCommissioner (State Tax) rejecting the transitional relief and\\ndemanding payment of an equivalent amount on the ground that it was\\nan excess claim. It is against the said order that the petitioner has come\\nup with the above writ petition.\\n11. Assailing the impugned order of rejection of transitional\\nrelief, it is contended by Mr. Anil Mukharjee, learned counsel for the\\npetitioner (1) that multiple notices by different persons holding the\\noffice at different points of time are bad in law, (2) that the impugned\\norder has been passed on the basis of provisions of law which are\\ninapplicable, (3) that in any case the simultaneous invocation of\\nsections 73 and 74 of the Act was wrong (4) that Rule 120 cannot\\noverride the Act, (5) that the three conditions laid down in the proviso\\nto Section 140(1) of the Act are not satisfied in this case, (6) that the\\nrespondents cannot rely upon the CCT circular dated 12.05.2015, as it5 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\nhas no application to GST law, which came into effect only in 2017\\nand (7) that the impugned order does not deal with various contentions\\nraised by the petitioner, in their reply.\\n12. In response to the above contentions, it is argued by Mr. J.\\nAnil Kumar, learned Special Standing Counsel that the case on hand is\\na classic example of the difficulties posed by the transition from VAT\\nregime to GST regime, even before the problems posed by the\\nbifurcation of the State got resolved. According to the learned Special\\nStanding Counsel, Section 140 of the Telangana GST Act does not\\ndeal with the question of apportionment between the bifurcated States\\nand that a clear mechanism was provided in the VATIS system as to\\nhow a dealer could utilize the Net Credit Carried Forward (NCCF).\\nAccording to the learned Special Standing Counsel, the petitioner\\nought to have claimed the benefit of 28 NCCF against the liabilities in\\nthe monthly returns in VAT 200 or CST-VI or the assessment\\nliabilities under both VAT and CST. They also had the option to claim\\nrefund, but the Dealer did not avail these opportunities. In this case, the\\nassessment for the period 2011-12 to 2013-14 was already completed\\nand hence, the learned Special Standing Counsel contended that a\\nDealer, who failed to take advantage of the mechanism provided,\\ncannot have any grievance.\\n13. We have carefully considered the above submissions.\\n14. It is seen from the impugned order that there is no dispute\\nabout the fact that there was excess credit carry forward (NCCF) to\\nthe tune of Rs.1,77,65,101/- as on 01.06.2014, immediately preceding6 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\nthe day on which the State was bifurcated. It is also admitted in the\\nimpugned order that after the bifurcation, the petitioner paid taxes to\\nthe tune of Rs.93,38,148/-, in cash, instead of adjusting the 28 NCCF.\\nOnly a small portion of the credit available to them was adjusted\\ntowards tax. It is further admitted in the impugned order that one of\\nthe prescribed mode of utilizing 28 NCCF, was to claim refund. But,\\naccording to the respondents, the State GST Act does not provide for\\nutilization of the 28 NCCF as transitional relief. Therefore, the second\\nrespondent concluded that the Assessing Authority has no such power\\nbeyond what is prescribed by the Statute and that the Dealer is always\\nat liberty to adjust the liabilities in pending assessments under VAT\\nand CST and thereafter claim refund.\\n15. In the light of the admitted facts reflected even in the\\nimpugned order, it is clear that the petitioner is not making an illusory\\nor stale claim, but is making a claim for something that he is entitled,\\neven according to the respondents, though in a different form.\\n16. To put it in simple terms, it is not the case of the\\nrespondents that the petitioner is claiming something that they are not\\nlawfully entitled. All that is stated by the second respondent is that\\nwhile the petitioner may be entitled either to adjust the available credit\\nagainst any liabilities under the VAT regime or to claim refund, they\\nare not entitled to seek transitional relief.\\n17. The provision for transitional relief is to be found in Section\\n140 of the Telangana GST Act, 2017. It reads as follows:7 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\n140. Transitional arrangements for input tax credit:- (1) A\\nregistered person, other than a person opting to pay tax\\nTransitional under section 10, shall be entitled to take, in his\\nelectronic credit ledger, credit of the amount of Value Added\\nTax [and Entry Tax] carried forward in the return relating to\\nthe period ending with the day immediately preceding the\\nappointed day, furnished by him under the existing law, not\\nlater than ninety days after the said day, in such manner as\\nmay be prescribed:\\nProvided that the registered person shall not be\\nallowed to take credit in the following circumstances, namely:-\\n(i) where the said amount of credit is not admissible as input\\ntax credit under this Act; or\\n(ii) where he has not furnished all the returns required under\\nthe existing law for the period of six months immediately\\npreceding the appointed date;\\nProvided further that so much of the said credit as is\\nattributable to any claim related to section 3, sub-section (3) of\\nsection 5, section 6, section 6A or sub-section (8) of section 8\\nof the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (74 of 1956) that is not\\nsubstantiated in the manner, and within the period, prescribed\\nin rule 12 of the Central Sales Tax (Registration and Turnover)\\nRules, 1957 shall not be eligible to be credited to the\\nelectronic credit ledger:\\nProvided also that an amount equivalent to the credit\\nspecified in the second proviso shall be refunded under the\\nexisting law when the said claims are substantiated in the\\nmanner prescribed in rule 12 of the Central Sales Tax\\n(Registration and Turnover) Rules, 1957.\\n(2) A registered person, other than a person opting to pay tax\\nunder section 10, shall be entitled to take, in his electronic\\ncredit ledger, credit of the unavailed input tax credit in respect\\nof capital goods, not carried forward in a return, furnished\\nunder the existing law by him, for the period ending with the\\nday immediately preceding the appointed day in such manner\\nas may be prescribed:\\nProvided that the registered person shall not be\\nallowed to take credit unless the said credit was admissible as\\ninput tax credit under the existing law and is also admissible as\\ninput tax credit under this Act.\\nExplanation.––For the purposes of this section, the\\nexpression ― “unavailed input tax credit” means the amount\\nthat remains after subtracting the amount of input tax credit\\nalready availed in respect of capital goods by the taxable\\nperson under the existing law from the aggregate amount of\\ninput tax credit to which the said person was entitled in\\nrespect of the said capital goods under the existing law.\\n(3) A registered person, who was not liable to be registered\\nunder the existing law or who was engaged in the sale of\\nexempted goods [or tax free goods] under the existing law but\\nwhich are liable to tax under this Act [or where the person was\\nentitled to the credit of input tax at the time of sale of goods],\\nshall be entitled to take, in his electronic credit ledger, credit\\nof the value added tax [and entry tax] in respect of inputs held\\nin stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished\\ngoods held in stock on the appointed day subject to the\\nfollowing conditions namely: ––\\n(i) such inputs or goods are used or intended to be\\nused for making taxable supplies under this Act;\\n(ii) the said registered person is eligible for input tax\\ncredit on such inputs under this Act;\\n(iii) the said registered person is in possession of\\ninvoice or other prescribed documents evidencing payment of\\ntax under the existing law in respect of such inputs; and8 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\n(iv) such invoices or other prescribed documents\\nwere issued not earlier than twelve months immediately\\npreceding the appointed day:\\nProvided that where a registered person, other than a\\nmanufacturer or a supplier of services, is not in possession of\\nan invoice or any other documents evidencing payment of tax\\nin respect of inputs, then, such registered person shall, subject\\nto such conditions, limitations and safeguards as may be\\nprescribed, including that the said taxable person shall pass on\\nthe benefit of such credit by way of reduced prices to the\\nrecipient, be allowed to take credit at such rate and in such\\nmanner as may be prescribed.\\n(4) A registered person, who was engaged in the sale of\\ntaxable goods as well as exempted goods [or tax free goods]\\nunder the existing law but which are liable to tax under this\\nAct, shall be entitled to take, in his electronic credit ledger,-\\n(a) the amount of credit of the value added tax [and\\nentry tax]carried forward in a return furnished under the\\nexisting law by him in accordance with the provisions of sub-\\nsection (1); and\\n(b) the amount of credit of the value added tax [and\\nentry tax] in respect of inputs held in stock and inputs\\ncontained in semi-finished or finished goods held in stock on\\nthe appointed day, relating to such exempted goods [or tax free\\ngoods] in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3).\\n(5) A registered person shall be entitled to take, in his\\nelectronic credit ledger, credit of value added tax [and entry\\ntax] in respect of inputs received on or after the appointed day\\nbut the tax in respect of which has been paid by the supplier\\nunder the existing law, subject to the condition that the invoice\\nor any other taxpaying document of the same was recorded in\\nthe books of account of such person within a period of thirty\\ndays from the appointed day:\\nProvided that the period of thirty days may, on\\nsufficient cause being shown, be extended by the\\nCommissioner for a further period not exceeding thirty days:\\nProvided further that the said registered person shall\\nfurnish a statement, in such manner as maybe prescribed, in\\nrespect of credit that has been taken under this sub-section.\\n(6) A registered person, who was either paying tax at a fixed\\nrate or paying a fixed amount in lieu of the tax payable under\\nthe existing law shall be entitled to take, in his electronic\\ncredit ledger, credit of value added tax in respect of inputs\\nheld in stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished\\ngoods held in stock on the appointed day subject to the\\nfollowing conditions, namely:–\\n(i) such inputs or goods are used or intended to be\\nused for making taxable supplies under this Act;\\n(ii) the said registered person is not paying tax under\\nsection 10;\\n(iii) the said registered person is eligible for input tax\\ncredit on such inputs under this Act;\\n(iv) the said registered person is in possession of\\ninvoice or other prescribed documents evidencing payment of\\ntax under the existing law in respect of inputs; and\\n(v) such invoices or other prescribed documents were\\nissued not earlier than twelve months immediately preceding\\nthe appointed day.\\n(7) The amount of credit under sub-sections (3), (4) and (6)\\nshall be calculated in such manner as may be prescribed.”9 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\n18. Obviously, the above provision is intended to take care of\\nthe contingency where a registered person has credit carried forward\\nin the return relating to the period ending with the day immediately\\npreceding the appointed day. Such a person is made entitled under\\nsub-section (1) of Section 140 of the Act to take credit in his\\nelectronic credit ledger. There are three provisos to sub-Section (1) of\\nSection 140 of the Act. The second and third provisos are not relevant\\nfor our purpose, as they relate to credit attributable to any claim\\nrelated to certain provisions of Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.\\n19. But the first proviso, which may be relevant, stipulates that\\nunder two contingencies, a registered person shall not be allowed to\\ntake credit. These contingencies are (1) where the amount of credit is\\nnot admissible as Input Tax Credit under this Act and (2) where the\\nregistered person has not furnished all the returns required under the\\nexisting law for the period of six months immediately preceding the\\nappointed day. It is not the case of the second respondent that the case\\nof the petitioner would fall under any of the contingencies stipulated\\nin the first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 140.\\n20. Sections 16 to 21 of the Telangana GST Act, 2017 deal with\\nInput Tax Credit. While Section 16 lays down the eligibility as well as\\nthe conditions for taking Input Tax Credit, Section 17 speaks about\\nthe apportionment of credit, when the goods or services or both are\\nused by the registered person partly for the purpose of any business\\nand partly for other purposes. Section 18 takes care of certain\\ncircumstances such as the one where ITC was available in respect of10 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\nthe inputs held in stock or semi finished or finished goods on the day\\nimmediately preceding the date from which a person became liable to\\npay tax under the GST Act. Section 19 deals with ITC in respect of\\nInputs sent for job work and Section 20 speaks about the manner of\\ndistribution of credit by input service distributor.\\n21. It is not stated in the impugned order that Section 140 does\\nnot have any application to the case on hand. All that is stated in\\nparagraph 2 of the impugned order is that it is only the amount\\navailable as ITC in the VAT DCB for the month of June 2017 that the\\npetitioner is eligible for claiming it as transitional relief. But, this is\\nnot supported by the provisions of Sections 16 to 21 of the TGST Act,\\n2017 so as to make the case of the petitioner fall under the first\\ncontingency contemplated in the first proviso to sub-section (1) of\\nSection 140. There is also no complaint by the respondents that the\\npetitioner failed to furnish all the returns required under the existing\\nlaw for the period of six months immediately preceding the appointed\\nday.\\n22. Even while rejecting the claim for transitional relief, the\\nsecond respondent has not only admitted the availability of excess\\ncredit in favour of the petitioner, but has also conceded that he\\npetitioner may either claim refund or adjust their liability against\\npending assessments under the VAT or CST Acts. But, it appears that\\nno assessment is pending either under the VAT Act or under the CST\\nAct. Therefore, the only way the petitioner can make use of this credit,\\neven according to the second respondent, is to make a claim for11 VRS,J & PKR,J\\nWP No.46792 of 2018\\nrefund. But, we do not know what difference it would make for the\\nrespondents, whether the petitioner seeks refund or seeks adjustment\\nof their liability under the GST regime.\\n23. Once it is admitted that credit was available to the petitioner\\non the date of switch over from VAT regime to GST regime and once\\nit is admitted that the petitioner may be entitled to make a claim for\\nthis credit in other modes, we think that the second respondent ought\\nto have given a purposive interpretation to Section 140 of the Act read\\nwith Sections 16 to 21 of the Telangana GST Act 2017. As he has\\nfailed to do the same, the matter requires reconsideration.\\n24. Therefore, the writ petition is allowed and the impugned\\norder is set aside and the matter remanded back to the second\\nrespondent for a fresh consideration in the light of the observations\\ncontained in this order. The second respondent may pass fresh orders\\nwithin a period of 4 weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this\\norder.\\n25. Consequently, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall\\nstand closed. No order as to costs.\\n__________________________\\nV. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J\\n____________________\\nP.

RADHAKRISHNAN\\nAND\\nTHE HON’BLE SRI JUSTICE A.RAJASHEKER REDDY\\nWRIT PETITION No.25759 of 2018\\nORDER :: ( per Hon’ble Sri Justice A. Rajasheker Reddy )\\nThe petitioners, the Commandant, Special Armed Reserve\\nCentral Police Lines, (SARCPL), Amberpet, Hyderabad and\\nothers, have challenged the order dated 08-02-2016 passed by\\nthe Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad, in\\nOA No.1175 of 2013 wherein and whereby the Tribunal\\nallowed the OA filed by the applicant-respondent herein and\\nset aside the order dated 30-11-2012 which imposed the\\npenalty of reduction in time scale of pay for two stages, for a\\nperiod of two years, with cumulative effect on future\\nincrements and pension, besides treating the unauthorized\\nsick period w.e.f. 19-05-2010 to 11-06-2010 as leave without\\npay and suspension period from 12-06-2010 to till he\\nreported for duty as ‘not on duty’ and consequently directed\\nto treat the suspension period as on duty for all purposes,\\nwithout monetary benefit and monetary benefit, be restricted4\\nto, subsistence allowance paid to the respondent, during his\\nsuspension period.\\n02. Facts briefly stated are that the respondent (applicant in\\nthe OA) is working as a Police Constable attached to SARCPL,\\nHyderabad, having been appointed in the year 1992 and\\ncontinuing as such in the said post. The respondent was\\nissued with proceedings dated 29-06-2010 placing him under\\nsuspension for his alleged involvement in a criminal case and\\nin that connection arrested by the Police, Malkajgiri,\\nHyderabad, on 12-06-2010 and remanded to judicial custody.\\nBesides registration of criminal case, articles of charges were\\nframed by the Department, by initiating departmental\\nproceedings and sought for his written explanation. Articles of\\ncharges framed reads as follows:-\\nCount no.1 :- Gross misconduct in falsely reporting sick on 19-05-\\n2010 and procured medical certificates for his fake illness with the\\nintention to cover up his guilt of involving in a criminal case and his\\narrest by civil Police.\\nCount no.2:- Involvement of Sri M. Ramesh, PC 1361 in\\nCr.No.161/2010, u/s.392 IPC. On 18-04-2010 along with his\\nnephew Sri M. Venkata Krishna intercepted the vehicle of victim Sri\\nD. Dayanand and robed cash of Rs.9700/- one gold ring and Nokia\\ncell phone.5\\n03. The respondent submitted his written statement, but not\\nsatisfied with the explanation offered, enquiry was ordered.\\nWith due participation of the respondent in the proceedings,\\nthe Enquiry Officer conducted enquiry and submitted his\\nreport dated 25-03-2011 to the disciplinary authority holding\\nthe charges as proved. Thereafter, the respondent was\\nprovided with a copy of the enquiry report and asked to\\nsubmit his remarks, who in turn, submitted his remarks\\nalong with a copy of the order in CC No.736 of 2010 wherein\\nthe competent criminal Court has acquitted him of the\\ncriminal charges. But the disciplinary authority by\\nproceedings dated 30-11-2012 imposed the penalty stated\\nsupra. Aggrieved thereby, the respondent filed the OA before\\nthe Tribunal. The Tribunal by the order impugned in this writ\\npetition, set aside the penalty imposed subject to certain\\ndirections noted supra. Hence, this writ petition by the\\nDepartment.\\n04. In the counter affidavit filed by the respondent, inter\\nalia it is stated that in the remarks submitted by him, it was6\\nspecifically brought to the notice of the disciplinary authority\\nthat the competent criminal Court has acquitted him of the\\nself same charges, but the disciplinary authority without\\nconsidering the same imposed penalty on him, which was\\nrightly set aside by the Tribunal. It is also submitted that he\\nreported sick w.e.f. 19-05-2010 to 02-07-2010 and during his\\nsick period, he was arrested on 12-06-2010 and released on\\nbail on 19-06-2010 and he was falsely implicated in the\\ncriminal case and as nothing could be recovered from him,\\nand his involvement was based on presumptions, the criminal\\nCourt had acquitted him observing that the prosecution failed\\nto prove his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. That there is\\nno misrepresentation to his superiors as he was already on\\nsick leave and his arrest during the sick period was on a false\\nground and the falsity is substantiated by the acquittal order\\npassed by the competent criminal Court.\\n05. The criminal case registered against the respondent, as\\nborne out from the record, was for an offence punishable\\nunder Section 392 IPC, r/w.Section 34 IPC in Cr.No.161 of7\\n2010. The criminal proceedings were set in motion based on\\nthe complaint lodged by one D. Dayanand complaining that on\\n18-04-2010, he after attending a party hosted by his friend at\\nAmbika Wines at HB Colony, Moulali, and about 10.30 pm,\\nand while he was going home and on the way when he reached\\nEveready Batteries Company, two unknown persons attacked\\nhim and due to the impact, the complainant fell down and\\nbecame unconscious and when re-regained conscious and\\nchecked his belongings, he could realize that his cell phone\\n(Nokia model no.58001), cash of Rs.9,700/- and one gold ring\\nweighing 05.6 tola was stolen and he immediately reported the\\nsame to the Police Malkajgiri. During the course of\\ninvestigation, the Police laid a trap with the stolen mobile IME\\nno.354182023838103 through third eye of Police Internet\\nPortal system and came to know that the stolen mobile cell\\nphone is being used by the son of the respondent and on\\napprehending the nephew of the respondent, he spilled the\\ndetails and stated that the son of the respondent is using the\\nstolen mobile cell phone and he confessed to the crime8\\ncommitted by him and the respondent on the fateful day; and\\nthat they distributed the stolen property equally. Based on the\\nFIR lodged by the complainant, the above crime was registered\\nand the accused i.e. the respondent (A-1) and his nephew (A-2)\\nwere remanded to judicial custody and later released on bail,\\nand as they pleaded not guilty, trial proceeded, but the\\ncriminal case registered as CC No.736 of 2010 ended in\\nacquittal as all the prosecution witnesses turned hostile and\\nthat order became final.\\n06. Heard the learned Government Pleader for Services-I for\\nthe petitioners and the learned counsel for the respondent.\\n07. In view of the rival contentions of the learned counsel for\\nparties, the point that arises for consideration is whether in\\nthe facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned\\nproceeding dated 08-02-2016 passed in OA No.1175 of 2013\\nis sustainable in law and; whether the order of acquittal\\nrecorded by the competent criminal Court in CC No.736 of\\n2010 is binding on the enquiry proceedings, as alleged by the\\nrespondent, as both the criminal and departmental9\\nproceedings proceeded on the same charges more so when the\\ncomplainant and the witnesses are one and the same.\\n08. The admitted facts are the respondent is a member of the\\ndisciplined force. The witnesses examined including the\\ncomplainant and other witnesses are same in the criminal\\ncase and the departmental proceedings. The respondent was\\nacquitted of the criminal charges by the competent criminal\\nCourt in CC No.736 of 2010 and order of the criminal Court\\nbecame final. The respondent was acquitted on account of the\\ncomplainant and the witnesses turned hostile and the\\nacquittal of the respondent is not on hot contest of the matter,\\nin other words it is not “an honourable” acquittal.\\n09. The respondent though claims to be on sick leave from\\n19–05–2010 to 02-07-2010 admits of being arrested on 12–\\n06–2010 and remanded to judicial custody and his release on\\nbail on 19–06–2010. According to the respondent’s version he\\nalong with his nephew went to attend a treat hosted by some\\nof his friends at Ambika wines at HB Colony and while they\\nreturning home, on reaching Eveready battery company, found10\\none cell phone on the road without sim card and he picked up\\nand waited about 1 ½ hours at the said place, with a fond\\nhope to return it the person to which the cell phone belong,\\nbut as none came to claim it, he took it to his house and his\\nson used it for a day. The Tribunal was persuaded to accept\\nthe submission of the respondent primarily on the ground that\\nthe charges in the criminal case and the charges in the\\ndepartmental proceedings, the complainant and the witnesses\\nare same and the competent criminal Court has acquitted the\\nrespondent, during the pendency of the departmental\\nproceedings, the disciplinary authority ought to have taken\\nnote of the fact of the findings of the competent criminal Court\\nand exonerated him of the charges. It is convenient to refer to\\nthe relevant portion of the order of the Tribunal, which is as\\nfollows:-\\n“…….The main witness is the victim. In the absence\\nof his witness and corroborate evidence to show that\\nstolen property was recovered from the possession of\\napplicant, the Enquiry Officer ought to have held him not\\nguilty of the charges. The findings of the Enquiry Officer\\nare based on surmises and conjectures, but not the11\\nevidence linking the applicant to the so-called crime. But,\\nthe disciplinary authority, instead of disagreeing with the\\nfindings, impose the penalty in question. The impugned\\npenalty order and the judgment of criminal Court in CC\\nNo.736 of 2010 were also cited, but no reasons are given\\nas to why the penalty in question was imposed against\\nthe applicant even though the victim has turned hostile….”\\n10. The Tribunal relied on the decisions in G.M.TANK vs.\\nSTATE OF GUJARAT,1 CAPT. M. PAUL ANTHONY vs.\\nBHARAT GOLD MINES LIMITED2 & CORPORATION OF THE\\nCITY OF NAGPUR, CIVIL LINES, NAGPUR vs. RAMCHANDRA\\nG. MODAK3 and observed that the judgment in criminal case\\ntakes precedence over the findings of the Enquiry Officer, if\\nthe incident is one and the same and accordingly set aside the\\npunishment imposed on the respondent.\\n11. It is contended by learned Government Pleader for\\nServices-I that the acquittal of the respondent in the criminal\\ncase is not “an honourable” acquittal and the acquittal is only\\non account of the complainant and witnesses turned hostile\\nand, therefore, the Tribunal ought not to have given much\\n1 (2006) 5 SCC 446\\n2 (1999) 3 SCC 679\\n3 AIR 1984 SC 62612\\ncredence to the finding given by the competent criminal Court\\nin setting aside the punishment imposed by the disciplinary\\nauthority. The Tribunal proceeded on the ground that the\\norder in the criminal case in acquitting the respondent ought\\nto have been taken note of by the disciplinary authority, such\\nan observation in our considered view cannot be appreciated\\nfor the reason that the acquittal in a criminal case is not an\\nhonourable acquittal and mere acquittal does not entitle the\\ndelinquent to automatic reinstatement, and as has been held\\nconsistently in various rulings of the Supreme Court,\\ndisciplinary action can be taken even after acquittal. The\\nobservation to this effect made by the Supreme Court in\\nUNION OF INDIA vs. BIHARI LAL SIDHANA,4 at para 5 of the\\njudgment deserves to be reproduced, which is as follows:-\\n“5.It is true that the respondent was acquitted by the criminal\\nCourt, but acquittal does not automatically give him the right to be\\nreinstated into the service. It would still be open to the competent\\nauthority to take decision whether the delinquent government\\nservant can be taken into service or disciplinary action should be\\ntaken under the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control &\\nAppeal) Rules……”\\n4 (1997) 4 SCC 38513\\n12. To the same effect is the ratio laid down in DEPUTY\\nINSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE vs. S. SAMUTHIRAM’5s\\ncase by the Supreme Court, wherein it is held that mere\\nacquittal of an employee by a criminal Court has no impact on\\nthe disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Department more\\nso when the respondent was not honourably acquitted by the\\ncriminal Court, but only due to the fact that the witnesses\\nturned hostile and other prosecution witnesses were not\\nexamined. It was further held that in the absence of any\\nprovision in the service rules for reinstatement, if an employee\\nis even honourably acquitted by a criminal Court, no right is\\nconferred on the employee to claim any benefit including\\nreinstatement.\\n13. It is to be seen that the decisions relied on by the\\nTribunal are distinguishable and are of little help to the\\nrespondent’s case. In BALJINDER PAL KARU vs. STATE OF\\n5 (2013) 1 SCC 59814\\nPUNJAB6 which considered the decisions in G.M.Tank’s case\\n(1 supra) and Capt. M. Paul Anthony’s case (2 supra), the\\nSupreme Court held that acquittal on account of witnesses\\nturned hostile and appeared to have been won over in a\\ncriminal case, cannot be a ground to interfere with the\\ndismissal order passed in departmental proceedings.\\n14. The Enquiry Officer considering the evidence of the\\nofficial and other witnesses including the complainant came to\\nthe conclusion that the charges levelled against the\\nrespondent are proved and such an finding was accepted by\\nthe disciplinary authority. The Tribunal should not have\\ndisturbed the finding of the Enquiry Officer, as approved by\\nthe disciplinary authority, basing on the criminal Court\\njudgment, which is not on merits. The degree of proof, in\\ndepartmental proceedings which can proceed on\\npreponderance of probabilities, unlike in criminal proceedings\\ncannot insist for strict proof beyond all reasonable doubt. As\\nseen from the version of the respondent himself in the enquiry,\\n6 (2016) 1 SCC 67115\\ntwo things are discernable i.e. during the relevant period, he\\nwas on sick leave and on the fateful day, he along with the is\\nnephew went to attend a treat hosted by his friends at Ambika\\nwines at HB Colony and while returning home in the night\\nfound a cell phone and he brought home and gave it to his son\\nand his son used it for a day. It is true that none of the\\nwitnesses, including the complainant did not support the case\\nof the prosecution nor the departmental proceedings. The case\\non hand is a case based purely on preponderance of\\nprobabilities and the sequence of events arranged together it\\nconnects the respondent with the alleged misconduct. It is\\ncontention of the learned counsel for the respondent that the\\nprosecution failed to connect the respondent with the alleged\\ncrime, the competent criminal Court has acquitted and de-\\nhors the same, the disciplinary authority proceeded in the\\nmatter and held the charges proved, without there being any\\nmaterial and it was rightly set aside by the Tribunal. It is also\\nstated that the opinion formed by the Enquiry Officer that\\nthe respondent is guilty of misconduct being a Policeman, was16\\non assumptions and without any legal basis and material on\\nrecord to support the same and, therefore, the Tribunal rightly\\ndisbelieved the finding of the Enquiry Officer and the\\nimpugned order warrants no interference.\\n15. In the departmental enquiry, though the complainant\\nand other witnesses turned hostile, the Inspector of Police\\nand the SI of Police, PS Malkajgiri, and during the course of\\ninvestigation collected evidence and recorded the statements\\nof witnesses and caused enquires and the crime party men\\nlaid a trap and located the house of the respondent through\\nstolen mobile IMEI number through 3rd eye Police Internet\\nportal and found the mobile phone of the complainant being\\nused by respondent’s son and on further investigation they\\narrested the respondent and his nephew and recovered the\\nstolen property from the nephew of the respondent.\\n16. The respondent has admitted the fact that the cell\\nphone of the complainant was found on the road on the\\nrelevant date and he picked up the cell phone. The respondent\\nbeing a member of a disciplined force ought to have surrender17\\nthe cell phone in the nearest Police station, instead he took the\\ncell phone with him and given it to his son for his use. It is\\nalso a fact that he was arrested and remanded to judicial\\ncustody. All these acts of the respondent goes to show that\\nthe respondent failed to inform about these acts, to his senior\\nOfficers of his unit and to avoid arrest falsely reported sick\\nduring the relevant period, as concluded by the Enquiry\\nOfficer in his report and accepted by the disciplinary\\nauthority.\\n17. It is also not explained by the respondent as to how he\\ncould attend the treat hosted by his friends on the fateful day,\\nthough he was on sick leave allegedly on account of back pain.\\nThe opinion formed by the Tribunal that the respondent is\\nentitled for the benefit of a clean chit though the Enquiry\\nOfficer found that the charges framed against him as proved\\nonly on the ground that he is acquitted of the criminal charges\\nby the competent Court, which is not “an honourable’\\nacquittal, but on account of the witnesses turned hostile,\\ncannot be judicially sustained. A judicious exercise of18\\ndiscretion would not be apparent if the reasoning is not in\\naccordance with law.\\n18. The presumption, though it cannot be inferred, the\\nrespondent being policeman could won over, if not terrorize\\nthe complainant and the witnesses, and that reason could not\\nbe ruled out for not turning up during the proceedings in the\\ncriminal case or in the departmental proceedings. It is equally\\ntrue that it would be difficult to brand a witness who turned\\nhostile is a witness who has been won over. However, evidence\\nof a witness cannot be discarded in its entirety barely on the\\nground that he has turned hostile. The evidence of a hostile\\nwitness can still be relied upon if it is otherwise found\\ntrustworthy. The findings of the Enquiry Officer in the\\ndepartmental proceedings is traceable to the misconduct\\nalleged and proved against the respondent. The punishment\\nimposed by the disciplinary authority is commensurate, if not\\ndeficient, with the misconduct on the part of the respondent.\\nThe respondent being a Policeman shown desperate character\\nand such act on his part is against public interest. Such acts19\\non the part of the member of the disciplined force would\\ntarnish the image of the Department. Rule 3 of the Telangana\\nCivil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964, requires that no\\nGovernment servant shall behave in a manner which is\\nunbecoming of such employee or derogatory to the prestige of\\nthe Government, though it is the exigencies of circumstances\\nthat determine as to what is becoming or unbecoming for a\\nGovernment servant to do or not to do.\\n19. For the reasons stated and in the totality of facts and\\ncircumstances, the order of the Tribunal is wholly\\nunsustainable and it is accordingly set aside. The punishment\\nimposed on the respondent by the disciplinary authority is\\nmaintained. In the result the writ petition is allowed. As a\\nsequel to the disposal of writ petition, miscellaneous petitions,\\nif any, pending shall stand closed. There shall be no order as\\nto costs.\\n_________________________________________\\nTHOTTATHIL B.

AMARNATH GOUD\\nWrit Petition No.943 of 2014\\nORDER : (Per Sri Justice M.S.Ramachandra Rao)\\nThe Background facts\\nThe petitioner in this Writ Petition is M/s ACC Limited, a\\nCompany registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and engaged in\\nthe manufacture of cement and cement products.\\n2. The petitioner was assessed to Sales tax during the years 1979-80\\nand 1980-81 on the turnover relating to packing material i.e gunnies\\nunder the APGST Act,1957 (for short ‘the Act’). Vide order\\ndt.27.3.1984, the original adjudicatory authority levied tax at basic\\nrates of 3% and 8% on packing material and cement respectively and\\ncompleted assessment for 1979-80. Similar order was passed on\\n20.3.1985 for the assessment years 1980-81.\\n3. Subsequently, the said orders were revised by the\\nDy.Commissioner (CT), Begumpet Division on 11.3.1987 (1979-80)\\nand 9.3.1987 (1980-81) on the ground that the Commercial Tax\\nOfficer had levied basic tax at 3% instead of 8% on packing material,\\nand so an additional demand was raised by Form B-3 demand notice.\\n4. The said additional demand was the subject matter of challenge\\nbefore the Supreme Court of India in WP.No.1688 of 1987. Pursuant::4:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nto an interim order passed by the said Court, petitioner paid\\nRs.13,03,679/- and Rs.15,06,753/- through Demand drafts bearing No.\\n014826 and 014827 both dt.31.5.1988 drawn on the Central Bank of\\nIndia, Secunderabad in favor of the Commercial Tax Officer,\\nCompany Circle, Punjagutta. The Supreme Court on 25.9.1989\\nremanded the matter to the 2nd respondent.\\n5. By order dt.24.1.1990, the 2nd respondent again confirmed the levy\\non packing material at the basic rate of 8% and levied additional tax\\nof Rs.28,10,432/-.\\n6. Aggrieved by the said order, petitioner preferred TA.No.s398 and\\n399 of 1990 before the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal.\\n7. The said Tribunal, by a common order dt.3.2.1993 allowed the\\nappeals filed by the petitioner.\\n8. In spite of the said orders the said amount of Rs.28,10,432/- was\\nnot refunded to petitioner. Petitioner therefore seeks refund of\\nRs.28,10,432/- from the respondent.\\n9. Further for 1991-92, there was a demand dt.22.1.20014 against the\\npetitioner for Rs.52,82,922/- and after adjusting the excess refund of\\nRs.28,10,432/- , petitioner paid the balance tax of Rs.24,72,450/-.\\n10. There was also an excess refund on 4.1.2009 of Rs.4,21,05,330/-\\nfor the years 1989-90, 1994-95, 1996-97 to 1999-00.::5:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\n11. While refunding the said amount through order Rc.No.21141/96-\\n97 dt.5.5.2009, the Dy.Commissioner (CT), Begumpet Division,\\nHyderabad ( respondent no.2) directed to withhold Rs.28,10,472/- for\\nwant of getting cross verification on payment details from the\\nCommercial Tax Officer concerned.\\n12. This is assailed by petitioner in this Writ Petition.\\nThe prayer in the Writ petition\\n13. The petitioner seeks a Writ of Mandamus declaring that the\\nimpugned order dt.5.5.2009 withholding the refund of Rs.28,10,432/-\\nis arbitrary, illegal and without jurisdiction; to set aside the same; and\\nto direct the respondents to refund the said amount with interest at\\n12% p.a from 2.8.1993 to 22.1.2004 as per Sec.33-F of the Act and\\nalso at 12% p.a from 5.11.2009 till date as per Sec.33-F of the Act\\napart from costs.\\n14. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents on\\n31.3.2015, it is stated that in the absence of realization particulars\\nrelating to the amount of Rs.28,10,432/-, credit was not given, which\\nresulted in withholding of the said amount.\\n15. So on 21.4.2015, a Division Bench presided over by Justice\\nR.Subash Reddy ( as his Lordship then was) recorded all the above\\nfacts , noted that under the Act, if there is delay in refunding the\\namount due to the assessee, interest is also required to be paid to the\\nassessee, called for a report from the Commissioner of Commercial::6:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nTaxes ( Telangana) to be submitted by 28.4.2015 indicating the\\nreasons for withholding the said amount and whether such amount\\npaid by the petitioner by way of Demand Draft were realized or not\\nand if not realized, why the same was not realized, and the persons\\nresponsible for such dereliction of duty.\\n16. Thereafter the matter was listed on 28.4.2015, 15.6.2015,\\n24.9.2019,24,10,2019,7,11,2019,13.11.2019 but no report as directed\\nby this Court in it’s order dt.21.4.2015 has been filed more than 4 ½\\nyears.\\n17. On 26.11.2019, this Court issued show cause notice to Mr.V.Anil\\nKumar, IAS, Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, State of Telangana\\nto show cause as to why proceedings under the Contempt of courts\\nAct, 1971 should not be initiated against him for willful disobedience\\nof the said order. The Special Government Pleader for the State of\\nTelangana was directed to communicate this order to the said officer.\\n18. Thereafter on 29.11.2019, an affidavit was filed by the said\\nOfficer stating that after he received the order dt.21.4.2015, he asked\\nthe Deputy Commissioner (CT) (FAC), Begumpet Division,\\nHyderabad to verify and report and that the latter gave a report on\\n27.4.2015.\\n19. In the said report dt.27.4.2015 of the Dy.Commissioner, he\\ncertified that the amount of Rs.28,10,432/- was paid by the petitioner\\nthrough the two Demand drafts mentioned above; that later the::7:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nCompany Circle was disbanded and the file of the petitioner was\\ntransferred to other circles such as Punjagutta, Begumpet and\\nSecunderabad Division; that letters were addressed to the Punjagutta\\nDivision and the S.D.Road Circle for particulars of challans for the\\nsaid DDs, but they expressed their inability to furnish the details; and\\nfor want of the challan particulars, refund could not be made to\\npetitioner of the said amount.\\n20. The Commissioner further stated that he informed the\\nGovernment Pleader on 18.6.2015 that the Dy.Commissioner (CT),\\nBegumpet informed him that he had contacted the District Treasury\\nOffice, but the latter had expressed inability to furnish the information\\nof the challans as only challans up to 3 years would be preserved as\\nper the State Government norms. He further stated he was retiring\\nfrom service the next day i.e.30.11.2019.\\n21. He denied that he committed contempt of court and stated that\\nthere was no intentional or deliberate disobedience of the orders\\npassed by the Court.\\nThe consideration by the Court\\n22. The fact however remains that the Commissioner did not file any\\nreport in this Court before 28.4.2015 or till 29.11.2019. He has thus\\nclearly disobeyed the order passed by this Court.\\n23. Be that as it may, admittedly the respondents admit in their\\ncounter affidavit filed on 31.3.2015 stating in para 6 that petitioner::8:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nhas paid Rs.13,03,679/- vide DD No.014826 dt.31.5.1988 and\\nRs.15,06,753/- vide DD No.014827 dt.31.5.1988 both drawn on the\\nCentral Bank of India in favor of Commercial Tax Officer,\\nPunjagutta.\\n24. The delivery of these Demand Drafts was as per Rule 35 r/w Rule\\n17 of the APGST Rules, 1957 pursuant to revision demand through\\nForm B-3 notice made by the 1st respondent who had given effect to\\nthe revision made by the 2nd respondent. By doing so, payment by the\\npetitioner was complete and nothing more was expected of it.\\n25. Sec. 64(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 makes\\npresentation of a bill of exchange (like a Demand Draft) to the drawee\\nequivalent to payment. In other words, handing over payment by\\nDemand Draft tantamounts to payment in cash and discharges\\npetitioner of it’s obligations. The presentation of the Demand draft\\nand it’s encashment is the exclusive responsibility of the respondents,\\nthe petitioner has nothing to do with it and the respondents cannot\\ntake advantage of any lapse , if any, in presenting the two Demand\\ndrafts to the Bank for realisation.\\n26. In National Sugar Industry and another v. Narala Venkiah\\n(Died) per L.R1 by the A.P.High Court, this Court also held that\\nhanding over Demand Drafts amounts to payment. In the said case,\\nthis Court held:\\n1 1994(3) ALT 276::9:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\n“12. Admittedly, the plaintiff had to pay 25% of the cost price to\\nthe defendants out of Rs. 2,34,715/-, amounting to Rs. 58,000/- for\\nwhich only Rs. 40,000/- were paid and a balance of Rs. 18,000/-\\nwere outstanding. This is made emphatic both in the pleadings and\\nthe evidence. But at the same time, admittedly, the balance out of\\n25% of the cost price was not at all paid much less the plaintiff\\nwas interested in paying the same as a part of pursuing or\\nconcluding the contract. Therefore, in other words, the transaction\\nfailed due to the non-payment of the agreed part payment of the\\ncost-price. There is nothing to indicate either from the pleadings\\nor from the evidence as to where the balance of the agreed part\\npayment was to be paid. Therefore, that may not decide the basis\\nto fix the jurisdiction of the court. However, there is a clear\\nadmission and evidence in the case that Rs. 40,000/- were paid by\\nthe plaintiff to the defendants by means of two bank drafts (one for\\nRs. 35,000/- and another for Rs. 5,000/-) which were handed over\\nto one Krishnaswami at Nirmal and it is not denied by the\\ndefendants that they received the drafts from Krishnaswami at\\nMadras. P.W.1. has testified about it in emphatic terms. … When\\nthe fact remains that Krishnaswami received the two drafts at\\nNirmal from the plaintiff through P. W.1. within Adilabad district\\nand handed over the same to the defendants, that should decide the\\nplace of payment and acceptance as a connecting factor regarding\\nthe cause of action. … As rightly pointed out by the learned\\nAdvocate for the plaintiff, payment by demand draft tantamounts to\\npayment by cash as the encashment of demand draft is not part of\\npayment. It is common knowledge that in case of demand draft\\nwhich is almost like a currency note, nothing more has to be done\\nto mean it encashment, except the receipt of the same. Therefore,\\nwhen the demand drafts were handed over by the plaintiff through\\nP.W.I to Krishnaswamiat Nirmal, the payment of Rs. 40,000/-was\\ncomplete. Therefore, that created part of cause of action to fix the\\nsitus of contract for the purpose of jurisdiction.”(emphasis\\nsupplied)::10:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\n27. A Full Bench of the Madras High Court in E.C.Muthuswami\\nGounder v. V.K.Chennimalai Goundar2 considered a situation\\nwhere a debtor had sent money to the creditor by way of money order.\\nA question arose for consideration ‘whether the date of payment i.,\\nacknowledgement of the debt is the date of payment made to the post\\noffice by the debtor or the date of receipt of the money by the\\ncreditor’. The Court held that the date the money was handed over to\\nthe post office will be the date of payment. It declared that if a debtor\\npays a cheque towards a debt which was not in dispute at that time\\nand there is a delay in encashment thereof, nevertheless the payment\\nby cheque made by the debtor to the creditor, as evidenced by the\\ncheque, is to be deemed to take effect from the date when the cheque\\nwas drawn and posted by the debtor to the creditor. The date when the\\ncreditor realizes the cheque is not significant. And the same principle\\nwould be applicable even to payments sent through the media of post\\noffice.\\n28. In CIT v. Ogale Glass Works Ltd.3, the Supreme Court also held\\nthat\\n“The engagement of the Government was to make payment by\\ncheques. The cheques were drawn in Delhi and received by the\\nassessee in Aundh by post. According to the course of business\\nusage in general to which, as part of the surrounding\\ncircumstances, attention has to be paid under the authorities\\n2 (1970) 1 MLJ 341 (FB)\\n3\\n(1955) 1 SCR 185 : AIR 1954 SC 429 : (1954) 25 ITR 529::11:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\ncited above, the parties must have intended that the cheques\\nshould be sent by post which is the usual and normal agency\\nfor transmission of such articles and according to the\\nTribunal’s findings they were in fact received by the assessee\\nby post. Apart from the implication of an agreement arising\\nfrom such business usage the assessee expressly requested the\\nGovernment to “remit” the amounts of the bills by cheques.\\nThis, on the authorities cited above, clearly amounted in effect\\nto an express request by the assessee to send the cheques by\\npost. The Government did act according to such request and\\nposted the cheques in Delhi. It can scarcely be suggested with\\nany semblance of reasonable plausibility that cheques drawn in\\nDelhi and actually received by post in Aundh would in the\\nnormal course of business be posted in some place outside\\nBritish India. This posting in Delhi, in law, amounted to\\npayment in Delhi. In this view of the matter the referred\\nquestion should, with respect, have been answered by the High\\nCourt in the affirmative. We, therefore, allow the appeal and\\nanswer the question accordingly.” (emphasis supplied).\\n29. We hold, on the basis of the above decisions , that once the\\nrespondents admit the receipt of both the Demand drafts dt.31.5.1988\\nfrom the petitioner for the sum of Rs.28,10,432/- , payment by the\\npetitioner is deemed to be complete and the petitioner is absolved of\\nit’s obligations; and the withholding of the refund by the respondents\\non the alleged ground that challans are not traceable in the Sub\\nTreasury of deposit of the Demand Drafts by the Commercial Tax\\nDepartment, after receipt of the Demand Drafts, i.e cross verification\\nis not possible, cannot be a valid reason at all to withhold the refund\\nof the said sum to the petitioner.\\n30. In our opinion, this action of the respondents is also violative of\\nArt.14, 19 , 265 and 300-A of the Constitution of India. The::12:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nrespondents cannot be permitted to take advantage of their own\\nnegligence, assuming that the Demand drafts handed over by the\\npetitioner, were not presented and encashed by the respondents.\\n31. In Reddy Laboratories Limited v. Asst. Commissioner (CT)\\nLTU4 and another, this aspect about delays in refund of Tax being\\nviolative of Art.265 of the Constitution of India was dealt with. The\\nDivision Bench of the A.P. High Court observed:\\n“12. … …on a mere subjective opinion that the refund would\\naffect the Revenue adversely, it cannot be withheld. The\\nGovernment as a litigant to the case before the appellate\\nTribunal cannot be permitted to withhold the refund only on the\\nground that they intend to file a tax revision case. Section 40(2)\\nof the VAT Act requires prior approval to withhold the refund by\\nthe Deputy Commissioner. When the statute prescribes the\\nauthority and also prescribe other authorities for\\nrefund/adjustment of VAT/TOT, notwithstanding the fact that the\\napproving authority is a higher official, the legislative choice of\\nconferring power on the Deputy Commissioner cannot be\\nignored. Even if the Joint Commissioner, by virtue of Rule 59 of\\nVAT Rules, is the authority to approve refund if the amount\\nexceeds Rs. 10,00,000/-, in the event of withholding refund,\\nnecessary approval of the Deputy Commissioner has to be\\nobtained. We do not find any inconsistency or incongruity\\ntherein. More often than not any quasi-judicial authority would\\nbe inferior in the organizational set up in comparison to an\\nauthority who takes administrative decisions. On that ground\\nalso the advice of the second respondent to the first respondent\\nbased on which the impugned endorsement is issued cannot be\\nsustained.\\n13. Before parting with this case, we are compelled to observe\\ncertain things that are recurring in the VAT administration in the\\n4 (2011) 37 VST 76 (AP) (DB)::13:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nState of Andhra Pradesh especially in the area of\\nrefunds/adjustments . More often than not we have come across\\ncases where Joint Commissioners/Additional Commissioners\\nhave sent proposals for refund to the Government and the\\napproval never comes from the Government. As observed by the\\nDivision Bench in BSNL, so as to achieve the distinction of\\nenforcing a fair tax paying structure, the State must act fairly. If\\nthe appropriate prescribed authority decides the amount to be\\nrefunded, any lapse on the part of the State Government or any\\nof its agents in withholding the same would certainly be violative\\nof Article 265 of the Constitution of India. Repeated\\ncontravention of Constitution provision cannot be approved. The\\nState Government would do well to prescribe a time schedule to\\nensure timeliness in granting approvals for refund of the\\namounts which it appears has been in place not by reason of the\\nstatute or the delegated legislation but only because of certain\\nexecutive instructions. As there is no challenge to these\\ninstructions, we refrain from saying anything more. The\\nargument that the delayed refund would attract interest at 12%\\nper annum is no answer if one appreciates the fact that no\\nbusinessman or merchant would like the money to be locked up\\njust for the sake of 12% return on the refund, which might come\\nlong after the requirement for money is over. Keeping this in\\nview, we direct the Government to pass appropriate orders in all\\npending refund matters within a period of six weeks.” (emphasis\\nsupplied)\\n32. A feeble defence was also raised by the learned government\\nPleader relying on Sec.33C of the APGST Act.\\n33. Section 33 enacts that the assessing authority or the licensing\\nauthority as the case may be, shall refund the tax or the license fee if\\nany paid, provisionally by an assessee or licensee for any particular\\nperiod if it is found to be in excess of the tax or the license fee payable\\nby him for the said period, or on the option of the assessee or licensee::14:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nto adjust such excess towards any tax or license fee due in respect of\\nany other period.\\n34. Sections 33A to 33F were inserted by Act 16 of 1963 w.e.f.\\n1.8.1963.\\n35. Section 33C of the Act states:\\n“S.33-C. Power to withhold refund in certain cases: Where an\\norder giving rise to a refund to an assessee or licensee is the\\nsubject matter of an appeal or further proceeding, or where any\\nother proceeding under this Act is pending, and the assessing or\\nthe licensing authority is of the opinion that the grant of the refund\\nis likely to adversely affect the revenue, the assessing or the\\nlicensing authority may, with the previous approval of the Deputy\\nCommissioner, withhold the refund till such time as the Deputy\\nCommissioner may determine.”\\n36. It thus empowers the assessing or licensing authority, if of the\\nopinion that the grant of refund is likely to adversely affect the\\nrevenue, where an order giving rise to a refund to an assessee or\\nlicensee is the subject matter of an appeal or further proceeding or\\nwhere any other proceedings under the Act of 1957 is pending, with\\nthe previous approval of the Dy. Commissioner, to withhold the\\nrefund till such time as the Dy. Commissioner may determine.\\n37. The provisions of Sections 33E and 33F deal with interest on\\ndelayed refund.\\n38. Section 33E mandates that if the assessing authority or the\\nlicensing authority does not grant the refund within six months from::15:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nthe date on which the claim for refund is made by the assessee or the\\nlicensee.\\n39. Under Section 33A, the State shall pay the assessee or licensee\\nsimple interest @ 12% p.a. on the amount directed to be refunded\\nfollowing the expiry of the period of six months aforesaid to the date\\nof the order granting the refund.\\n40. Section 33F enjoins that where a refund is due to the assessee or\\nlicensee in pursuance of an order referred to in Section 33B and the\\nassessing or licensing authority does not grant the refund within a\\nperiod of six months from the date of such order, the State shall pay\\nthe assessee or the licensee simple interest @ 12% p.a. on the amount\\nof refund due from the date following the expiry of the period of six\\nmonths aforesaid to the date on which the refund is granted.\\n41. Sub-section (2) of Section 33F deals with the refunds withheld\\nunder the provisions of Section 33C and enjoins the State Government\\nto pay interest @ 12% p.a. on the amount of refund ultimately\\ndetermined to be due as a result of the appeal or further proceedings\\nfor the period commencing after the expiry of six months from the\\ndate of the order referred to in Section 33C to the date the refund is\\ngranted.\\n42. In Pulp N'Pack Private Ltd. vs. The Commercial Tax Officer\\nand Ors5. , a Division Bench of the A.P. High Court considered the\\n5 MANU/AP/0094/2009 = 2009(23) VST 573 (DB)(AP)::16:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\nscope of exercise of the discretionary power under Sec.33 C by the\\ncompetent authority to with hold refunds o Tax under the APGST Act,\\n1957. It held:\\n“36. From an interactive analysis of the provisions of the 3rd\\nproviso to Sections 21(2), 33-C and 33-F(2) it is apparent: (a)\\nthat where no order withholding a refund is passed exercising\\npower Under Section 33C, simple interest @ 18% p.a. on the\\namount of deposit to be refunded shall have to be paid if refund\\nof the deposit is not made within 60 days from the date of\\nreceipt of the order passed Under Section 19 or 21; and (b)\\nthat where an order withholding a refund is passed Under\\nSection 33C and the amount of refund is ultimately determined\\nto be due as a result of an order in an appeal or further\\nproceeding, simple interest @ 12% p.a. shall become payable\\non the amount of refund determined to be due, if the same is\\npaid after the expiry of 6 months from the date of the order\\nreferred to in Section 33-C to the date the refund is granted.\\n37. In the above circumstances an order Under Section 33C\\nwithholding the refund does adversely impact the dealer. Not\\nonly is he deprived of a higher rate of interest payable by the\\nState for delayed refund of the amounts deposited (at 12% as\\nagainst 18% p.a.) but the period for which interest is payable\\nis also postponed pejoratively to the dealer's interest i.e., after\\n60 days from the date of receipt of an order passed Under\\nSections 19 of 21 [vide the 3rd proviso to Section 21(2)]; as\\nagainst the dealer's entitlement to only a lower percentage of\\ninterest (12% p.a.) and if the refund is withheld for a period\\nbeyond 6 months from the date of the order referred to in\\nSection 33C [Section 33-F(2)].\\n38. Since Section 33-C confers a discretionary but not an\\nabsolute power to withhold refund and only on the formation of\\nan opinion as to the adverse impact on revenue, the assessing\\nauthority must exercise discretion on relevant grounds and for\\ngermane reasons.::17:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\n43. If power granted for a particular purpose by the Statute, is\\nexercised for a different purpose, that power has not been\\nvalidly exercised. If the exercise of a discretionary power is\\ninfluenced by considerations that cannot lawfully be taken into\\naccount or by the disregard of relevant considerations required\\nto be taken into account, the Courts would hold that the power\\nhas not been validly exercised. The interpretation of statutory\\npurpose and of the relevancy of considerations are closely\\nrelated; since the question in regard to the considerations\\ntaken into account in reaching a decision is normally whether\\nthat consideration is relevant to the statutory purpose. Where\\nthe statutory purpose is explicit, the power conferred, though\\ndiscretionary, is a grant of discretion to be exercised within the\\nlocus of the permitted statutory purpose. Whether the exercise\\nis consistent with the statutory purpose is an aspect falling\\nwithin judicial review.”\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n43. In the instant case, the respondents had withheld the refund for\\n11 years on ground of ‘want of cross-verification details’ which is not\\na ground mentioned in Sec.33-C for withholding the refund due to\\npetitioner.\\n44. Admittedly no proceeding such as an appeal or revision was\\npending against the petitioner. So Sec.33 F(2) of the APGST Act is\\nalso inapplicable.\\n45. Also a refund withholding order must invariably specify (as per\\nSec.33C) the period of time during which it will be in force and a\\nrefund cannot be withheld indefinitely as has been done in the instant\\ncase.::18:: MSR,J & TA,J\\nwp_943_2014\\n46. Sec.33-E and 33-F of the APGST Act give 6 months time to the\\nrespondents to complete the verification and the authorities cannot\\nwith hold the refund beyond the said period.\\n47. Thus there has been an ex-facie abuse of power by the respondents\\n1 and 2 in denying refund to the petitioners of the sum of\\nRs.28,10,432/-.\\n48. Therefore the writ petition is allowed with costs of Rs.25,000/- to\\nbe paid by the 5th respondent to the petitioner; a Writ of Mandamus is\\nissued declaring that the impugned order dt.5.5.2009 of the 2nd\\nrespondent withholding the refund of Rs.28,10,432/- is arbitrary,\\nillegal and without jurisdiction; the said order is accordingly set aside;\\nand the respondents 1-5 are directed to refund the said amount with\\ninterest at 12% p.a from 2.8.1993 to 22.1.2004 as per Sec.33-F of the\\nAct and also at 12% p.a from 5.11.2009 till date as per Sec.33-F of the\\nAct.\\n49. As a sequel, miscellaneous petitions pending if any, in this Writ\\nPetition, shall stand closed.\\n____________________________\\nM.S.RAMACHANDRA RAO, J\\n_______________________\\nT.AMARNATH GOUD, J\\nDate: 27.04.2020\\nSVV/NDR/VSV\\nNote L.R. copies to be marked.\\nB/o Svv\",\n",

Petitioner is a\\nregistered partnership firm represented by its Managing Partner seeks\\nspecific performance of Agreement dated 03.02.2006 (wrongly typed as\\n03.02.2010 in paragraph 8 and 9 of the plaint) with respect to suit\\nschedule property admeasuring Ac.4.07 guntas (equivalent to 20273\\nsquare yards in Survey No.194/1, G.L.R. Survey No.255 falling under\\nSecunderabad Cantonment Area situated at Ramakrishnapuram\\n(Gandhinagar), Secunderabad Cantonment, Malkajgiri village and mandal,\\nRanga Reddy District.\\n2. In the plaint, the detailed description with respect to the entering\\ninto a contract for purchase of land in Survey No.194/1 and also in Survey\\nNo.211 starting with an MoU in 2016 and subsequent documents alleged to\\nhave been executed between the parties was mentioned. For the purpose\\nof resolving the controversy in the present CRP, the details with respect to\\nthe same are not necessary except to state that the plaintiffs alleged to\\nhave been delivered with the possession of the suit schedule property.\\n3. Invoking Order I Rule 10(2) read with Section 151 CPC, the plaintiff\\nsought to implead respondents 3 to 5 in the suit as defendants 3 to 5. As\\nper the averments in the affidavit filed in support of the petition, the\\npetitioners found that employees of 5th respondent at the suit are site\\nclaiming right over the property and on further enquiry, the petitioners\\ncame to learn that the respondents 1 and 2 (Defendants 1 and 2), to create\\nmultiplicity of proceedings and in order to avoid the execution of Sale Deed4 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\npursuant to agreements entered into with the petitioners in collusion and in\\nconnivance with the respondents 3 to 5, created a Deed of Mortgage\\npurporting to mortgage the suit schedule property along with the other\\nproperties on behalf of respondent No.3 in favour of respondent No.4 vide\\nMortgage Deed bearing No.1380/2015 dated 15.12.2015. The 4th\\nrespondent alleged to have assigned the debt owed and all its rights by\\nassignment deed dated 28.03.2015 in favour of 5th respondent Asset\\nReconstruction Company. Petitioner also learnt that 5th respondent had\\ninitiated certain proceedings under Securitization and Reconstruction of\\nFinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (for short,\\n“SARFAESI Act”). The creation of mortgage in favour of 4th respondent by\\nthe respondents 1 and 2 is nonest in law and the same is in violation of\\nstatus quo orders dated 04.01.2013 in I.A.No.28 of 2013. Petitioner\\nasserts that the mortgage and the assignment deeds executed are illegal,\\nvoid and not binding on the plaintiff and as the said documents are creating\\ncloud over the petitioner’s right over the suit schedule property and for\\neffectual conveyance of property in their favour pursuant to the Agreement\\nof Sale dated 03.02.2006, petitioner seeks to implead respondents 3 to 5\\nas defendants 3 to 5 in the suit. Petitioner asserts that respondents 3 to 5\\nare necessary and proper parties for effective adjudication of the dispute.\\n4. Respondent No.4 filed counter asserting that the petitioner be put to\\nstrict proof of respective averments in the affidavit. It is asserted that the\\ncreation of mortgage, assignment of debt and the mortgaged property in\\nfavour of the 5th respondent has been done strictly according to the rules;\\nthat the suit filed in 2013 with respect to alleged AGPA of the year 2006\\nand the petition filed after four years of mortgage and the same is collusive\\nwith defendants 1 and 2 and the delay is not explained; that they are not\\nnecessary or proper parties and hence prays for dismissal of the petition.5 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\n5. Respondent No.5 filed a separate counter denying the averments of\\nthe affidavit contending that the guarantee documents executed by the 3rd\\nrespondent in favour of 4th respondent and subsequent documents\\nexecuted in favour of 4th and 5th respondents cannot be disputed and\\nfurther the petitioner would not have better rights over the respondents 4\\nand 5 with respect to suit schedule property.\\n6. Learned District Judge having considered the respective submissions\\ndismissed the I.A. holding that the AGPA is not a public document and the\\nproposed parties are not necessary parties as respondents 3 to 5 have no\\nnexus with AGPA, and the petitioner has other remedies against\\nrespondents 3 to 5 with respect to violation of status quo orders dated\\n04.01.2013 in I.A.No.28 of 2013.\\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the deed of mortgage\\ndated 15.12.2015 is not a bona fide transaction; that the order of status\\nquo dated 04.01.2013 was prior in time than the deed of mortgage\\nexecuted on 15.12.2015; that the mortgage deed is in respect of property\\nin Survey No.194/1 which is the subject matter of O.S.No.1 of 2013; that\\nrespondents 3 to 5 are proper parties to decide whether the transaction is\\nbonafide; that the petitioner is entitled to un-encumbered property as the\\nmortgage is subsequent encumbrance; that respondents 3 to 5 will be\\naffected by the outcome of the suit as the property under mortgage deed\\nand the suit O.S.No.1 of 2013 is the same; that impleadment is necessary\\nto put the prospective auction purchasers on notice; that impleadment does\\nnot go against Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act, as the bar is only with\\nrespect to matters covered under Debts Recovery Tribunal Act which are\\nspecified under SARFAESI Act, and pertain to recovery proceedings initiated\\nby bank under Section 13(2).6 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\n8. Learned counsel for the respondent No.5 submits that respondent\\nNo.5 is neither necessary nor proper party in deciding the suit claim and in\\na specific performance suit, the only issue that is required to be decided is\\nwhether the plaintiff/petitioner is entitled for specific performance of\\nagreement of sale with respect to the suit schedule property; and the 5th\\nrespondent being the assignee with respect to the rights of the 4th\\nrespondent under SARFAESI Act would get all the rights in law of the 4th\\nrespondent and therefore neither the 4th respondent nor the 5th respondent\\nare necessary or proper parties for deciding the lis in the suit.\\n9. Having heard both the learned counsels at length and having\\nperused the respective pleadings and the judgments cited, the questions\\nwhich fall for consideration are:\\n1) Whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the\\nrespondents 3 to 5 are required to be impleaded as defendants 3 to 5\\nin the suit filed by the plaintiff/petitioner seeking specific performance\\nof Agreement of Sale dated 03.02.2006?\\n2) Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the order in\\nI.A. is liable to be interfered with?\\n10. At the outset, it may be stated that a large number of precedents\\nwere placed before this Court by the learned counsel for the petitioner and\\nsome of the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the respondent.\\nHaving given anxious thought and after critically analyzing the large\\nnumber of cases cited before this Court, to avoid confusion, the judgments\\ncan be divided into two categories; namely (1) allowing Order I Rule 10\\napplications; and (2) rejecting the Order I Rule 10 applications.

It may be noted that the in the first judgment of the Supreme Court\\nin Ramesh Hirachand Kundanmal v. Municipal Corporation of\\nGreater Bombay1, it was categorically held after referring to the judgment\\nof Supreme Court in Razia Begum v. Anwar Begum2 has held that the\\ncourt is empowered to join a person whose presence is necessary for the\\nprescribed purpose and cannot under Sub Rule 2 of Order 10 direct the\\naddition of a person whose presence is not necessary for the purpose of\\neffectually and completely adjudicating upon and settling all the questions\\ninvolved in the suit. Paragraph 8 of Ramesh Hirachand reads as under:\\n1 (1992) 2 SCC 524\\n2 [1959] SCR 111110 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\n“8. The case really turns on the true construction of the rule in\\nparticular the meaning of the words “whose presence before the Court\\nmay be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and\\ncompletely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in\\nthe suit”. The Court is empowered to join a person whose presence is\\nnecessary for the prescribed purpose and cannot under the rule direct\\nthe addition of a person whose presence is not necessary for that\\npurpose. If the intervener has a cause of action against the plaintiff\\nrelating to the subject matter of the existing action, the Court has\\npower to join the intervener so as to give effect to the primary object\\nof the order which is to avoid multiplicity of actions.”\\n12. It was further held that in relation to disputes relating to properties\\nin order that a person may be added as a party, he should have a direct\\ninterest as distinguished from a commercial interest in the subject matter\\nof litigation. In para 11, it was held that the object of Order I Rule 10 may\\nincidentally have the effect of avoiding multiplicity of actions, the same is\\nnot the determinative factor. In paragraph 14, it was held as under:\\n“14. It cannot be said that the main object of the rule is to present\\nmultiplicity of actions though it may incidentally have that effect. But\\nthat appears to be a desirable consequence of the rule rather than its\\nmain objective. The person to be joined must be one whose presence\\nis necessary as a party. What makes a person a necessary party is\\nnot merely that he has relevant evidence to give on some of the\\nquestions involved; that would only make him a necessary witness. It\\nis not merely that he has an interest in the correct solution of some\\nquestion involved and has thought of relevant arguments to advance.\\nThe only reason which makes it necessary to make a person a party to\\nan action is so that he should be bound by the result of the action and\\nthe question to be settled, therefore, must be a question in the action\\nwhich cannot be effectually and completely settled unless he is a\\nparty. The line has been drawn on a wider construction of the rule\\nbetween the direct interest or the legal interest and commercial\\ninterest. It is, therefore, necessary that the person must be directly or\\nlegally interested in the action in the answer, i.e., he can say that the\\nlitigation may lead to a result which will affect him legally that is by\\ncurtailing his legal rights. It is difficult to say that the rule\\ncontemplates joining as a defendant a person whose only object is to\\nprosecute his own cause of action. Similar provision was considered\\nin Amon v. Raphael Tuck & Sons Ltd {(1956) 1 All ER 273}, wherein\\nafter quoting the observations of Wynn-Parry, J. in Dollfus Mieg et\\nCompagnie S.A. v. Bank of England {(1950) 2 All ER 605, 611}, that\\ntheir true test lies not so much in an analysis of what are the11 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\nconstituents of the applicants’ rights, but rather in what would be the\\nresult on the subject matter of the action if those rights could be\\nestablished. Delvin, J. has stated:\\n“The test is ‘May the order for which the plaintiff is asking\\ndirectly affect the intervener in the enjoyment of his legal rights’.”\\n13. The judgment in Ramesh Hirachand’s case and Anil Kumar\\nSingh’s case were referred to with approval by three-judge bench\\njudgment in Kasturi’s case and also the judgment of Anil Kumar Singh’s\\ncase. It may further be noted that in Anil Kumar Singh’s case, Lala\\nDurga Prasad v. Lala Deep Chand3 case was referred, however, it may\\nbe noted that the issue whether the subsequent purchaser is required to be\\nmade as a party respondent did not arise, however, by placing reliance on\\nSection 40 of Transfer of Property Act, Section 3 and Section 27 of Specific\\nRelief Act, 1877, and Section 91 of Indian Trusts Act, 1882, alternatives\\navailable for the Court while passing the decree were set out. It may be\\nnoted that the Specific Relief Act, 1877, stands repealed with enactment of\\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963. Likewise, the Razia Begum’s case also was a\\ncase decided in the context of Specific Relief Act, 1877.\\n14. All the subsequent judgments, taking one view or other, had turned\\non the fact situation found in the respective cases. A close reading of para\\n14 and 15 of Kasturi’s case leave no manner of doubt that the\\ncontroversy raised between the plaintiff and defendant alone are required\\nto be gone into and not the disputes which may arise between the parties\\nto the suit and third party. As can be seen from the table of judgments\\nreferred to, though some of the judgments which are later in point to the\\nthree-judge bench judgment in Kasturi’s case, in the facts of those cases\\nhad held that subsequent purchaser/the person claiming rights in a\\nproperty in preference to the plaintiff seeking specific performance may be\\n3 1954 AIR 75 == 1954 SCR 36012 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\nadded as a party, this Court is mandated to follow the judgment of the\\nlarger Bench in preference to the judgments of the subsequent smaller\\nBenches following the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in State of\\nU.P. v. Ram Chandra Trivedi4, and in Union of India v. K.S.\\nSubramanian5.\\n15. In the present case, the rights that are being claimed by the plaintiff\\narise on account of Agreement of Sale with the defendants 1 and 2, and the\\nrights which are being claimed by the contesting respondents 4 and 5 in\\nthe trial Court and by the 5th respondent before this Court are admittedly\\nbased on the amounts lent to respondent No.3, on the strength of\\nguarantees executed by respondent No.3 and other collateral guarantees\\nexecuted by respondents 1 and 2. Further, it may be noted that a\\nmortgagee has independent rights. Apart from that, respondent No.4\\nbeing a ‘banking company’ as defined under Section 2(d) of the Recovery\\nof Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (for short, “DRT\\nAct”), a ‘financial institution’ as defined under Section 3 of the Insolvency\\nand Bankruptcy Code, ‘secured creditor’ as defined under Section 2(zd) of\\nthe SARFAESI Act, and respondent No.5 being an Asset Reconstruction\\nCompany as defined under Section 2(d)(ia) of the DRT Act and under\\nSection 2(b)(ba) of the SARFAESI Act, have certain independent, statutorily\\nconferred rights with respect to the debts/monies owed by the respondent\\nNo.3, and in that view of the matter, they cannot be equated with the\\nparties acquiring rights by way of a judgment and decree in relation to an\\nimmovable property in a specific performance suit.\\n16. So far as the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that\\nthe joining of the proposed respondents as defendants would avoid\\n4 1976 SC 2547\\n5 1976 AIR 243313 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\nmultiplicity of proceedings, binding the successors in interest of defendants\\n1 and 2 though sounds attractive in the first blush, the same is required to\\nbe negatived as, at this stage, the joining of proposed respondents would\\nbe virtually denying their rights and the legal defences which they may be\\nentitled to put forth, based on the mortgage obtained by them, and also\\nthe legal rights conferred under the Acts referred to in the previous\\nparagraphs whereunder a different fora and procedure is specified.\\n17. The enquiry with respect to the rights in the present suit would\\ncertainly enlarge the scope of the simple specific performance suit. On the\\nother hand, in law, the decree that may be obtained by the\\nplaintiff/petitioners would be binding on the subsequent acquirers of rights\\nwhatever they may be, subject to their rights. In that view of the matter,\\nthe dismissal of I.A. cannot be found fault.\\n18. Accordingly, the Civil Revision Petition is dismissed. No costs.\\nMiscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand dismissed.\\n____________________\\nCHALLA KODANDA RAM, J\\n23rd April, 2021\\nksm14 crp_2432_2019\\nCKR, J\\nTHE HON’ BLE SRI JUSTICE CHALLA KODANDA RAM\\nCIVIL REVISION PETITION No.2432 of 2019\\n23rd April, 2021\\nksm',\n",

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff, learned\\ncounsel for the respondent Nos.2 to 5/defendant Nos.2 to 5 and\\nperused the record.\\n3. Inspite of service of notice on the respondent No.1/defendant\\nNo.1, there is no representation on his behalf.\\n4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner/plaintiff would\\ncontend that the Court below erroneously dismissed the subject\\nInterlocutory Application vide impugned order dated 03.11.2020,\\nwithout following the principles laid down under Order VI Rule 17 of\\nCPC. It is submitted that in the subject suit, during cross-\\nexamination of PW.1-petitioner/plaintiff, certain material facts with\\nregard to the execution and registration of sale deeds by the\\nrespondent No.1/defendant No.1 have come up and that lead to\\nfiling of the subject amendment application seeking cancellation of\\nthose sale deeds and declaring them as null and void. The said\\namendment is within time. Further, there is no change in material3\\nfacts. It is also contended that the proposed amendment is\\nnecessary for proper adjudication of the subject matter of the suit\\nand ultimately prayed to allow the revision petition as prayed for.\\nIn support of his contention, learned counsel relied upon the\\ndecision reported in Kovvuri Ramakrishna Reddy vs. Padala\\nSatyanarayana Reddy1.\\n5. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent Nos.2 to 5/\\ndefendant Nos.2 to 5 would submit that in Para 6 of the plaint, the\\npetitioner/plaintiff specifically mentioned about the execution and\\nregistration of sale deeds by the respondent No.1/defendant No.1.\\nTherefore, the contention of the revision petitioner/plaintiff that he\\ncame to know about the execution and registration of sale deeds\\nonly at the time of his cross-examination (P.W.1), is unsustainable.\\nThe revision petitioner ought to have been diligent in drafting the\\nplaint and seek cancellation of sale deeds. The suit was filed on\\n16.09.2015, whereas the subject application seeking amendment\\nwas filed on 28.11.2019, which is beyond the period of limitation, as\\nprescribed in Article 58 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The Court below\\nrightly dismissed the subject Interlocutory Application vide\\nimpugned order dated 03.11.2020 and ultimately prayed to dismiss\\nthe revision petition. In support of his contentions, learned counsel\\nrelied upon the decisions reported in Ankam Govindamma v. Syed\\nShafeeullah2 and South Konkan Distilleries and another v.\\nPrabhakar Gajanan Naik and others3.\\n1 2012 (5) ALD 56\\n2 (2018)4 ALT 421\\n3 (2008)14 SCC 6324\\n6. In view of the submissions made by both sides, the point that\\narises for determination is:\\n“Whether the impugned order dated 03.11.2020\\npassed in I.A.No.1041 of 2019 in O.S.No.29 of\\n2015 by the learned II Additional District Judge,\\nNalgonda District at Suryapet, is liable to be set\\naside and consequently, the subject I.A.No.1041\\nof 2019 be allowed as prayed for?”\\n7. POINT:- As seen from the material placed on record, the\\nrevision petitioner/plaintiff filed the subject suit in O.S.No.29 of\\n2015 against the respondents/defendants, seeking specific\\nperformance of agreement of sale dated 21.09.2012 in respect of\\nthe suit schedule property. During pendency of the said suit, the\\nrevision petitioner/plaintiff filed the subject I.A.No.1041 of 2019\\nseeking amendment of the plaint. The Court below after hearing\\nboth sides, vide impugned order dated 03.11.2020, dismissed the\\nsubject application.\\n8. The main contention of the revision petitioner/plaintiff is that\\nhe came to know about the execution and registration of subject\\ndocuments by the respondent No.1 only during his (PW.1) cross-\\nexamination and hence, he sought amendment of the plaint seeking\\ncancellation of those sale deeds and to declare them as null and\\nvoid. Whereas the contention of the respondent Nos.2 to 5/\\ndefendant Nos.2 to 5 is that the revision petitioner/plaintiff has\\nknowledge about the execution and registration of subject\\ndocuments by the respondent No.1, at the time of filing of the\\nsubject suit and the same was specifically mentioned in Para 6 of\\nthe Plaint.5\\n9. Here, it is apt and appropriate to extract Order VI Rule 17 of\\nCPC, which reads as follows:\\nOrder VI Rule 17- Amendment of Pleadings:\\nThe Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either\\nparty to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on\\nsuch terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be\\nmade as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the\\nreal questions in controversy between the parties:\\nProvided that no application for amendment shall be allowed\\nafter the trial has commenced, unless the Court comes to the\\nconclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party could not\\nhave raised the matter before the commencement of trial.\\n10. As seen from the material placed on record, in Para 6 of the\\nplaint, there is a specific mention with regard to the alienation,\\nexecution and registration of the subject documents by the\\nrespondent No.1/defendant No.1. It establishes that the revision\\npetitioner/plaintiff has knowledge with regard to the execution and\\nregistration of the subject documents by respondent No.1. Even\\nthen, the revision petitioner/plaintiff did not seek the relief of\\ncancellation of those documents in the subject suit.\\n11. In Kovvuri Ramakrishna Reddy’s case (1 supra) cited by\\nthe learned counsel for the revision petitioner/plaintiff, it was held\\nthat under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code, the Court is vested with\\nthe discretion to allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings\\nfor the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy\\nbetween the parties. However, under the proviso thereto, the\\napplication for amendment shall not be allowed after the trial has\\ncommenced, unless the Court comes to the conclusion that inspite6\\nof due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before\\nthe commencement of trial. This proviso was added with a view to\\ncut-down the delays and not to encourage the litigants who are\\neither not diligent or who want to indulge in vexatious litigation for\\nprolonging the suit proceedings. However, mere delay in filing such\\nan application cannot constitute the sole ground for rejecting the\\napplication for amendment of the plaint. The provisions of Order VI\\nRule 17 of the Code are procedural, which, if interpreted in a pure\\nliteral sense, may some times cause grave injustice to the parties.\\n12. In Ankam Govindamma’s case (2 supra), cited by the\\nlearned counsel for the respondent Nos.2 to 5/defendant Nos.2 to 5,\\nit was held that the amendment petition filed after commencement\\nof trial no doubt can be considered, provided, the petitioner therein\\ncould establish that inspite of exercising due diligence he could not\\nfile the petition before commencement of the trial and a separate\\nsuit on same cause of action for the same relief could be\\nmaintainable.\\n13. In the case of South Konkan Distilleries’s case (3 supra),\\nthe Hon’ble Apex Court held that one of the cardinal principles of law\\nin allowing or rejecting an application for amendment of the\\npleading is that the courts generally, as a rule, decline to allow\\namendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred\\nby limitation on the date of filing of the application. But that would\\nbe a factor to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion\\nas to whether the amendment should be ordered, and does not\\naffect the power of the Court to order it, if that is required in the\\ninterest of justice. It is well settled that the Court must be7\\nextremely liberal in granting the prayer for amendment, if the Court\\nis of the view that if such amendment is not allowed, a party, who\\nhas prayed for such an amendment, shall suffer irreparable loss and\\ninjury. It is also equally well settled that there is no absolute rule\\nthat in every case where a relief is barred because of limitation,\\namendment should not be allowed. It is always open to the Court to\\nallow an amendment if it is of the view that allowing of an\\namendment shall really subserve the ultimate cause of justice and\\navoid further litigation. In the instant case, the subject suit was filed\\non 16.09.2015. In Para 6 of the plaint, there is specific mention of\\nexecution and registration of subject sale documents. However, the\\nrevision petitioner/plaintiff did not seek cancellation of those sale\\ndocuments. The written statement was filed on 29.10.2015 after\\ndue notice to the revision petitioner/plaintiff. In the written\\nstatement also there are full details of subject sale documents. The\\nsubject application seeking amendment to cancel the sale\\ndocuments was filed on 28.11.2019 i.e, beyond the period of\\nlimitation of three(3) years as prescribed in Article 58 of Limitation\\nAct, 1963. The revision petitioner/plaintiff ought to have claimed\\nentire reliefs in one suit, which he did not do so, for the reasons\\nbest known to him. Moreover, the subject suit is for specific\\nperformance of agreement of sale, wherein the alternative relief to\\nrefund the amount of Rs.20,80,000/- paid by the revision petitioner/\\nplaintiff to the defendant No.1, is also claimed. The decision in\\nKovvuri Rama Krishna Reddy’s case (1 supra) relied upon by the\\nlearned counsel for the revision petitioner relates to a suit filed for\\ndeclaration of title but in the instant case, the factual matrix are\\nquite different. Admittedly, the subject amendment application8\\nseeking cancellation of registered sale documents is made beyond\\nthe period of three(3) years from the date of knowledge of the\\nexistence of the documents. Generally, an application to amend the\\npleadings is required to be filed at any stage before the proceedings\\nare finally terminated. However, there is a bar, the application for\\namendment shall not be allowed after trial has been commenced,\\nunless the Court comes to conclusion that inspite of due diligence,\\nthe party could not have raised the matter before the\\ncommencement of the trial. The averments of the plaint as well as\\nthe written statement patently makes clear that the revision\\npetitioner was not diligent and there is willful omission on the part of\\nthe revision petitioner in seeking the relief of cancellation of subject\\nsale documents. The cardinal principles of law in allowing or\\nrejecting an application for amendment of pleadings are that if a\\nfresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by limitation on\\nthe date of filing of the application, the Court has to decline to grant\\nthe amendment sought for. The Court must be extremely liberal in\\ngranting the prayer of amendment, if the Court is of the view that if\\nsuch amendment is not allowed, a party, who has prayed for such\\nan amendment, shall suffer irreparable loss and injury. The instant\\ncase is for specific performance of agreement of sale and the\\nalternative relief claimed is to refund the amount paid by the\\nplaintiff to the defendant No.1. In such an event, it cannot be\\nconstrued that the revision petitioner/plaintiff will suffer irreparable\\nloss or injury if his application to amend the pleadings is not\\nallowed. The proposed amendment will not subserve the cause of\\njustice in favour of the revision petitioner. There is patent omission\\non the part of the revision petitioner in not seeking the relief of9\\ncancellation of subject documents in the suit filed at the first\\ninstance. The revision petitioner has consciously omitted to do so.\\nEvery suit shall include the whole of the claim, which the plaintiff is\\nentitled to make in respect of the cause of action. Where a plaintiff\\nomits to sue in respect of any portion of his claim, he shall not\\nafterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted. So in the instant\\ncase, there is omission on the part of the plaintiff in seeking the\\nrelief of cancellation of subject sale documents. After the expiry of\\nthe period of limitation he is not entitled to seek such a relief by\\namending the plaint. The trial Court while examining the\\ncontentions of both the parties, rightly held that the amendment\\napplication was filed belatedly and that there are no bona fide\\nreasons to allow the subject application.\\n14. Here it is apt to mention that the scope of the High Court\\nunder Article 227 of the Constitution of India is very narrow. The\\nHigh Court, in exercise of its power under Article 227 of the\\nConstitution of India, should interfere with an order, only to keep\\nthe Tribunals and Courts subordinate to it within the bounds of their\\nauthority and to ensure that law is followed by such Tribunals and\\nCourts by exercising jurisdiction which is vested in them and by not\\ndeclining to exercise the jurisdiction which is vested in them. Apart\\nfrom the above, High Court can interfere in exercise of its power of\\nsuperintendence, when there has been a patent perversity in the\\norders of the Tribunals and Courts subordinate to it or where there\\nhas been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic\\nprinciples of natural justice have been flouted. In the instant case,\\nneither there is patent perversity in the order under challenge nor10\\nthe Court below travelled beyond its jurisdiction in passing the\\nimpugned order. The Court below discussed the material on record\\nat length and rightly dismissed the subject Interlocutory Application,\\nassigning reasons. There is nothing to take a different view. Under\\nthese circumstances, there is no irregularity or perversity in the\\nimpugned order dated 03.11.2020 passed by the Court below. The\\nCivil Revision Petition is devoid of merit and is liable to be\\ndismissed.\\n15. In the result, the Civil Revision Petition is dismissed.\\nAs a sequel, the miscellaneous petitions, pending if any, shall\\nstand closed. There shall be no order as to costs.\\n______________________\\nDr. SHAMEEM AKTHER, J\\nDate: 16.04.2021\\nNote: LR copy to be marked\\n(b/o)\\nssp/scs\",\n",

Heard the submissions of Sri B.Anil, learned counsel for the\\npetitioners, Sri G.Malla Reddy, learned Assistant Government Pleader\\nfor Home appearing on behalf of the learned Additional Advocate\\nGeneral for the respondents and perused the record.ARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n2 W.P.No.1554/2021\\n3. The facts of the case, in a nutshell, are that by relying on two\\ncases registered against the detenue in the year 2020, viz., (1) Crime\\nNo.102/2020 of Meerpet Police Station registered for the offences\\nunder Sections 3 & 4 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956\\nand Section 370(A)(2) of IPC; and (2) Crime No.1075/2020 of Uppal\\nPolice Station registered for the offences under Sections 3, 4 & 5 of\\nthe Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 and Section 370(A)(2) of\\nIPC, the respondent No.2-Commissioner of Police, Rachakonda,\\npassed the impugned detention order, dated 02.01.2021. According\\nto the respondent No.2, the detenue is a ‘Immoral Traffic Offender’\\nand that she, along with her associate, has been organizing\\nprostitution by procuring girls from West Bengal State, Hyderabad\\nand other parts of Telangana State through her agents and\\norganizing prostitution clandestinely by acting as a leader/member of\\ncriminal gang to make easy money. With a view to prevent the\\ndetenue from indulging in such illegal and dangerous activities which\\nare prejudicial and detrimental to the maintenance of public order,\\nthe impugned detention order, dated 02.01.2021, was passed. The\\ndetention order was confirmed by the respondent No.1, by order,\\ndated 17.03.2021. Hence, this writ petition before this Court.\\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioners, inter alia, vehemently\\ncontended that as on the date of passing of the impugned detention\\norder, dated 02.01.2021, the detenue was pregnant. Neither the\\ndetenue nor her mother (petitioner No.1) were aware of the said fact\\nin order to bring the same to the notice of the detaining authority\\nwhile passing the impugned detention order. However, the detenue\\ncame to know about the same only after her detention by virtue of\\nthe impugned detention order. On this sole ground, the impugnedARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n3 W.P.No.1554/2021\\ndetention order is liable to be set aside and the detenue can be\\nreleased from prison, since an unborn child in the womb of the\\ndetenue cannot be punished for the wrongdoings, if any, of the\\ndetenue. As per Article 21 of the Constitution of India, nobody is\\nempowered to take away the fundamental right of life and personal\\nliberty of a person, except by the procedure established by law. An\\nunborn child deserves all the fundamental rights and he/she should\\nbe granted the ‘Right to life’ as per Article 21 of the Constitution of\\nIndia, similar to a normal person, because the unborn child has\\nprepared himself to enjoy the journey of life since the day of\\nconception. Having submitted so, the learned counsel ultimately\\nprayed to set aside the impugned detention order and the\\nconsequential confirmation order and allow the writ petition as prayed\\nfor.\\n5. On the other hand, the learned Assistant Government Pleader\\nfor Home appearing for the respondents fairly conceded that the\\ndetenue is pregnant, but contended that the said fact was not\\nbrought to the notice of the detaining authority while passing the\\nimpugned detention order. He further vehemently contended that\\nleaving apart the aspect of pregnancy of the detenue, the detaining\\nauthority is legally justified in passing the impugned detention order.\\nThe detenue is an ‘Immoral Traffic Offender’. She along with her\\nassociate was organizing prostitution by procuring innocent girls from\\nother states by means of human trafficking through agents. Her\\nimmoral activities highly endanger the family system and are harmful\\nto inhabitants of the locality. The detenue was organizing\\nprostitution clandestinely by exploiting innocent girls/women\\ndeceitfully as a member of the gang and causing wide-spread ofARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n4 W.P.No.1554/2021\\ncontagious and sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, Syphilis, etc.,\\nand thereby endangering public health at large. Since the detenue\\nwas granted bail by the Courts concerned in both the crimes relied by\\nthe detaining authority, there is imminent possibility of the detenue\\nindulging in similar illegal activities again, which are prejudicial and\\ndetrimental to the maintenance of public order. Hence, the detaining\\nauthority is justified in passing the impugned detention order. The\\nsubjective satisfaction recorded by the detaining authority for\\npreventively detaining the detenue cannot be said to be illegal or\\ntainted on any account. All the constitutional guidelines have been\\nstrictly followed by the detaining authority while passing the\\nimpugned detention order. There are no grounds to grant the relief\\nsought by the petitioners and ultimately prayed to dismiss the writ\\npetition.\\n6. In view of the submissions made by both the sides, the point\\nthat arises for determination in this Writ Petition is:\\n“Whether the detention order, dated 02.01.2021,\\npassed by the respondent No.2 and the\\nconsequential confirmation order, dated\\n17.03.2021, passed by the Government of\\nTelangana are liable to be set aside?”\\nPOINT:\\n7. Before proceeding further, it is the case of the petitioners that\\nthe detenue was pregnant as on the date of passing of the impugned\\ndetention order. However, no material is placed before this Court by\\nthe petitioners to substantiate the said contention. However, the\\nlearned Assistant Government Pleader for Home appearing for the\\nrespondents fairly conceded that the detenue, who is presentlyARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n5 W.P.No.1554/2021\\nlodged in special prison for women, Chanchalguda, Hyderabad, by\\nvirtue of the impugned detention order, is pregnant. Law stipulates\\nthat admitted facts need not be proved. Section 58 of Indian\\nEvidence Act provides that no fact need to be proved in any\\nproceeding, which the parties thereto, or their agents, agree to admit\\nat the hearing, unless the court believes that the said fact needs to\\nbe proved. If a submission made by a counsel is fairly conceded by\\nthe other side counsel, asking the counsel who made such submission\\nto prove the same would be waste of time and effort. Under these\\ncircumstances, the Court would be well within its jurisdiction to take\\njudicial notice of the said fact and proceed with the case. Judicial\\nnotice is taken upon the request of a party that submits the fact.\\nRelevant facts that are admitted under judicial notice are accepted by\\nthe Court even without producing a witness to prove such fact. This\\nrule is often used for the simplest and obvious facts that are\\nconsidered to be common sense and need not be proved. Under\\nthese circumstances, this Court deems it appropriate to take judicial\\nnotice of the fact that the detenue is pregnant.\\n8. In view of the fact that the detenue is pregnant, our anxious\\nconsideration is with regard to the constitutional safeguards with\\nregard to the welfare of the fetus in the womb of the detenue vis-à-\\nvis detention of the detenue, and the effect of detention on the\\nunborn child. Thus, we deem it appropriate to lay emphasis on the\\nsaid aspect at the first instance.\\n9. A child is considered to be a gift of god to human beings. A\\nchild is also known as another form of God. Though it is legal to\\nabort a child in our country, it is debatable whether a child should be\\ngranted Right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the ConstitutionARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n6 W.P.No.1554/2021\\nof India, when it is a fetus. Apart from the definition of ‘fetus’ as per\\nmedical terminology, we may say that fetus is a ‘human organism in\\ndevelopment until birth’. A child’s heart starts beating between the\\nsecond and third week of pregnancy, which means a human being\\nhas already started to develop in the metra of mother. However, a\\nfetus is not covered under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It\\nfollows that the fetus will not be provided with the benefit of Article\\n21, until it comes into existence, which may happen when the child\\ncomes out of the metra of the mother alive. However, it does not\\nmean that the fetus is not subject to receive any of the rights\\nguaranteed by the Constitution of India. A child in its mother's\\nwomb, for many purposes, is regarded by a legal fiction as already\\nborn, according to the maxim ‘Nasciturus pro iam nato habetur\\nquotiens de commodis eius agitur’, which means that ‘an unborn child\\nis considered born, when his interests are taken into account’. Even\\nthe unborn ones should be protected from any sort of harm and\\nhardship. Laws should be stringent to make sure that a person can\\nbe held liable for causing harm to a person, who, at the time of the\\ninjury, is not born.\\n10. Article 21 of the Constitution of India mandates that no person\\nshall be deprived of his life or personal liberty, except according to\\nprocedure established by law. In this context, firstly it has to be\\nexamined as to whether a fetus in the womb of mother can be\\ntermed as a “person”, so as to confer on him/her, the benefit of\\nArticle 21 of the Constitution. In fact, in an article named liberty of\\nborn v. life of unborn1 written by Justice A.M.Bhattacharjee, the then\\nChief Justice of Calcutta and Bombay High Courts, His Lordship was\\n1 (1985) 2 SCC (Jour) 10ARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n7 W.P.No.1554/2021\\nof the opinion that a fetus in the womb of the mother is a non-\\nnatural, but legal person. In the said article, His Lordship observed\\nas follows:\\n“There should be no doubt that a foetus or a child in the mother's\\nwomb is not a natural person; but it is said that there should\\nequally be no doubt that it is a juristic or juridical person. It is said\\nthat in all jurisprudential jurisdictions, a child en ventre sa mere is\\nrecognized as a legal person, capable of inheriting or otherwise\\nacquiring and holding property and also other rights. In India,\\nunder the Hindu Law, a son is entitled to have reopened the\\npartition of the ancestral property taking place while he was in the\\nmother's womb without keeping any share reserved for him. In\\nthe Law of Wills both in India and in England, a child in the\\nmother's womb is considered to be in existence and Section 99(i)\\nof the Indian Succession Act, 1925, clearly provides that “all words\\nexpressive of relationship apply to a child in the womb who is\\nafterwards born alive”. The distinction made in Sections 312 to 316\\nof the Indian Penal Code, 1860, between a woman with child and\\na woman quick with child and between an unborn child and a quick\\nunborn child goes to show, as was pointed out in a century old\\nMadras Division Bench decision [Queen-Empress v. Ademma,\\n(1886) ILR 9 Mad 369], that under the Indian Criminal Law, a\\nwoman is with child during the entire period of her pregnancy and\\nlexically and as well as legally, a child is a person having life. The\\nEnglish expression ‘pregnant’ means to be with child and the\\nIndian equivalent ‘antaswatta’ unmistakably means to have life\\nwithin. But granting that a child in the womb is not a natural but\\nonly a legal person, is a non-natural but legal person not entitled to\\nthe protection of the life/liberty/property clauses? A non-natural\\nbut legal person, like a statutory corporation or a company, has all\\nalong been treated as person within the meaning and protection of\\nthe equality clauses of the Constitution guaranteeing to\\nevery person, equality before the law and equal protection of the\\nlaws. A non-natural but legal person, being thus undoubtedly\\na person within the meaning and protection of the life/liberty/\\nproperty and the equality clauses of the Constitution, no such\\nperson, it has been argued, can be deprived of life, if it has any,\\nwithout due process. Since a foetus or child in the mother's womb,\\neven though a non-natural person, would nevertheless be\\na person within the meaning of the Article 21 of the Indian\\nConstitution, it cannot be deprived of its life, if it has one, without\\ndue, i.e., reasonable, right, just and fair process.\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n11. While life beyond death might still be a philosophical enigma,\\nlife before birth in the mother's womb is a physiological phenomenon.\\nVarious legislations in India recognized the rights of an unborn child.\\nSection 6 of the Limitation Act recognizes an infant in the womb of\\nmother as a minor. As per Section 2(e) of the Indian Succession\\nAct, a minor is anyone who is below the age of eighteen, which\\ninclude fetus. As per sections 312 to 316(8) of the Indian PenalARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n8 W.P.No.1554/2021\\nCode, anyone who will prevent a child being born alive, or for causing\\nthe death of a quick unborn child will be punished depending on the\\ncase type. Section 316 of Indian Penal Code further goes to the\\nextent of saying that causing death of quick unborn child amounts to\\nculpable homicide. Section 20 of Hindu Succession Act recognizes\\nthe right of the child in the metra of the mother. It treats the unborn\\nchild in the womb of the mother in the same way as a born child for\\nthe purpose of inheritance of intestate of a dead person. Section 13\\nof Transfer of Property Act, 1882, characterizes an unborn infant as a\\nchild or an infant in its mother’s metra. An individual yet to born\\ndoesn’t have any presence and is not considered a living individual\\nbut still, the property can be transferred to the baby. Section 416 of\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, prescribes that the High Court\\nshall order the execution of sentence to be postponed, if the woman\\nwho is imposed death penalty, found to be pregnant and may, if it\\nthinks correct, commute the sentence to imprisonment for life. Thus,\\nit is clear that law has given utmost importance to the unborn child.\\nFurther, it is clear that an unborn infant deserves equal and identical\\nrights which a normal person has, for the simple reason that an\\nunborn child also exists physically in the metra of the mother. The\\nunborn child starts to develop himself since the day of conception and\\nstarts getting himself ready to ride the journey of life. Various\\nlegislations, as indicated above, recognizes and protects the interest\\nof an unborn child. Thus, we are of the view that the unborn child\\ndeserves the Right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution,\\ninasmuch as the unborn child has prepared himself to enjoy the\\njourney of life since the day of conception.ARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n9 W.P.No.1554/2021\\n12. Courts have been mindful of the fact that the unborn child is\\ninnocent of all wrongdoing and ought not to be subjected to the\\ndistressful conditions that inhere in detention. While several\\nprescriptions exist in health related documents for the care and well\\nbeing of the fetus in the womb of the mother, the issue requires\\nparticular attention in the context of the confinement of the mother\\nin a custodial institution like prison. The dominant principle seems\\nto be that imprisonment should be the last resort. In R.D.\\nUpadhyaya v. State of Andhra Pradesh2, the Hon’ble Apex Court,\\nwhile dealing with the condition of children who are in jail because\\nof their mothers’ imprisonment and after referring to the Draft\\nPrison Manual framed by the ‘National Expert Committee on Women\\nPrisoners’, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer, issued guidelines at para\\n45, inter-alia, directing as follows:\\n“childbirth in prison should be avoided as far as possible\\nand measures of temporary release/parole including\\nsuspended sentence should be made to enable expectant\\nprisoner to have her delivery outside prison.”\\n13. Further, the Gujarat High Court, in the case between State of\\nGujarat v. Jadav @ Jatin Bhagvanbhai Prajapati3 speaking\\nthrough Justice M.R. Shah (as His Lordship then was), even while\\nconvicting and sentencing a pregnant woman to seven years\\nimprisonment for a dowry death, simultaneously suspended her\\nsentence for about ten months on account of her pregnancy.\\n14. The underlying principle behind the above said rulings and\\nguidelines is the welfare and safety of the fetus. The concern is that\\nthe fetus should receive the healthiest possible environment to\\n2 AIR 2006 SC 1946\\n3 Decided on 01.02.2016 in Criminal Appeal No.652 of 2008ARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n10 W.P.No.1554/2021\\ndevelop and born alive, and thereafter, receive the best possible\\nnurture and care, integral to which is the mother’s mental and\\nphysical health. It is not a mere concern for the mother’s health.\\nThe predominant concern is thus for the unborn child, which is\\ninnocent of all wrongdoings, and ought not to be subjected to the\\ndistressful conditions that inhere in detention. The safety, security\\nand personhood of the fetus is secondary only to the interest of the\\nmother and her health, depending upon the stage of pregnancy.\\nHowever, the subordination of the fetus, even to the mother’s\\ninterest, is not absolute. Further, jeopardizing the fetus can never\\nbe the State’s interest. The life, health and safety of the fetus, far\\nfrom being in thrall to any act, decision or policy of the State,\\nrequire protection from the State. The State’s power with regard to\\nthe childbirth should be accumulated to protect and enhance life,\\nbut not to threaten.\\n15. Further, we may say that incarceration of the mother would\\ncertainly amount to de facto detention of her unborn child, who is\\nimmune of all wrongdoings. Indisputably, an unborn child in the\\nwomb of the mother cannot be punished for the wrongdoings of\\nmother. Women subjected to restraint during childbirth may report\\nsevere mental distress, depression, anguish and trauma. Further,\\nsome pregnancies require utmost medical attention, both pre-natal\\nand post-natal, and advanced medical technology. Prisons may not\\nbe equipped with such medical staff and advanced medical\\ntechnology and may not meet the needs of a woman who develop\\ncritical illness in labour or ensure safe delivery of a baby. Further, a\\nwoman during pregnancy needs extra care and attention and a\\nnutritious diet. She should be free from stress. For the proper careARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n11 W.P.No.1554/2021\\nof the unborn child, the mother should be provided a stress free\\nenvironment, unlike a prison. Further, pregnant women need unique\\nhealthcare needs. These needs are often not addressed by most\\ncorrectional institutions like prisons, which may put these women at\\nrisk. There is also a risk of a pregnant prisoner experiencing physical\\nand emotional abuse, mental health issues and untreated sexually\\ntransmitted infections.\\n16. Though the dead possess no legal personality, it is otherwise in\\nthe case of an unborn. It may not be out of place to mention that\\nspecial and specific provisions have been made in Part III and IV of\\nthe Constitution of India, besides other provisions, for care, welfare\\nand development of the children. The best interest of the child has\\nbeen regarded as a primary consideration in our Constitution. Article\\n15 prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or\\nplace of birth. Article 15(3) provides that this shall not prevent the\\nState from making any special provision for women and children.\\nArticle 14 provides that the State shall not deny to any person,\\nequality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the\\nterritory of India. Article 21 provides that no person shall be\\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure\\nestablished by law. Article 39(f) directs the State to ensure that\\nchildren are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy\\nmanner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood\\nand youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and\\nmaterial abandonment.\\n17. A life that affects the physical and mental health of a pregnant\\nwomen, which in turn affects the health of the unborn child in theARR,J & Dr.SA,J\\n12 W.P.No.1554/2021\\nwomb of mother, is not a proper life at all. The right of an unborn\\nchild, when balanced against the rights of a woman bearing the child,\\nthe scale would certainly tilt in favour of the woman. The life and\\nliberty of the mother cannot be extricated from that of an unborn\\nchild, as there is no life for a fetus separated from that of its mother.\\nThus, protection of health and well being of an incarcerated pregnant\\nwoman is a matter that certainly requires greater attention by the\\nCourts of law and other law enforcing agencies. In the instant case,\\nthe fact remains that the detenue is right now eight months\\npregnant. The detenu was not aware of her pregnancy when the\\ndetention order was passed. She discovered it during the period of\\ndetention, which has not been disputed by the respondents. Had this\\nfact been brought to the notice of the detaining authority, the\\ndetaining authority might have taken a different view.\\n18. For the foregoing reasons, without expressing any opinion on\\nthe other merits of the matter, we deem it appropriate to set aside\\nthe impugned detention order, dated 02.01.2021, and the\\nconsequential confirmation order, dated 17.03.2021, on the ground\\nof pregnancy of the detenue alone.\\n19. In the result, the Writ Petition is allowed.

LAKSHMAN\\nCRIMINAL APPEAL No.1284 OF 2008\\nJUDGMENT:\\nAssailing the judgment, dated 14.10.2008, passed by the V Additional\\nMetropolitan Sessions Judge (Mahila Court) at Hyderabad in Sessions Case\\nNo.253 of 2008, the appellants - Accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 preferred the\\npresent appeal.\\n2. Vide the aforesaid judgment, the trial Court convicted the\\nappellants - accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 for the offence under Section 4 of the\\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and imposed sentence of simple imprisonment\\nfor a period of six (06) months each and to pay fine of Rs.10,000/- each and\\nin default of payment of fine to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of\\nthree (03) months each.\\n3. It is relevant to note that originally Narayanaguda Police Station,\\nHyderabad charged accused Nos.1 to 5 for the offences under Sections 498-\\nA and 306 IPC. The trial Court framed charges under Sections 498-A and\\n306 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (for short\\n‘Act, 1961’). Vide the aforesaid judgment, the trial Court acquitted accused\\nNos.1 to 5 for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 IPC and Section 3\\nof the Act, 1961. The trial Court also acquitted accused Nos.3 and 5 for the\\ncharge under Section 4 of the Act, 1961.\\n4. According to the prosecution, on 26.07.2007 at about 12.00 noon, a\\nTelugu written report was filed by the complainant (Accused No.1) stating\\nthat on 25.07.2007 at about 16:30 hours, his wife (deceased0 locked the\\nhouse and handed over the keys to one Latha by informing her that she was3\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\ngoing to purchase vegetables. Thereafter she did not return. The\\ncomplainant searched for his wife in the house of his relatives, but could not\\ntrace her out.\\n5. Basing on the said complaint, Narayanaguda Police Station\\nregistered a case in Crime No.276 of 2007 under the head ‘Woman\\nMissing’.\\n6. According to the prosecution, on 27.07.2007 at about 9.00 a.m.,\\nPW.6, Supervisor of St. Anthony’s High School, Himayathnagar, came to\\nthe Police Station, Narayanaguda and informed that he found female dead-\\nbody in Ashoknagar Drainage Nala situated behind their school. The police\\nrushed to the spot and got the dead body removed from the Canal.\\nThereafter, PW.11, Sub-Inspector of Police, secured the presence of\\nAccused No.1 and got the dead body identified as that of his wife.\\n7. According to the prosecution, on 27.07.2007 at about 8.00 p.m., a\\nTelugu written report was lodged by the father of the deceased alleging that\\nthe marriage of the deceased was performed with accused No.1 on\\n20.03.1992 with dowry of Rs.10,000/-, one and half tolas of gold and 10\\ntolas of silver. The couple lived happily till they were blessed with one son.\\nThereafter, all the accused started harassing the deceased for additional\\ndowry. During the marriage of sister of the deceased, her in-laws demanded\\nadditional dowry and did not attend the marriage. In that regard, the\\ncomplainant (father of deceased) made several attempts to pacify the matter.\\nHe has also promised to arrange the amount from his retirement benefits.\\nBut, there is no change in the attitude of the accused and they have4\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\ncontinued the said the harassment demanding additional dowry. As such,\\nthe deceased attempted to suicide by pouring kerosene on her body.\\n8. It is also alleged in the complaint that the complainant gave an\\namount of Rs.50,000/- to accused No.1 from his retirement benefits. But,\\nafter few months, the accused viz., husband, mother-in-law, sister-in-law,\\nher husband and brother of accused No.1 again started harassing the\\ndeceased for additional dowry. On 25.07.2007 at about 19.00 hours, the\\ncomplainant was informed by accused No.1 that his daughter (deceased) was\\nnot available at the house and her whereabouts were not known. On that, he\\nsearched for her but could not trace her out. On 27.07.2007, he received\\nmessage from accused No.1 that the dead body of the deceased was found\\nlying in a nala of Ashok Nagar. On that, the complainant and his family\\nrushed to the spot and identified the dead body.\\n9. Basing on the said complaint and statement of the father of the\\ndeceased, the police altered the provision of law from Section 174 Cr.P.C. to\\nSections 498-A and 306 IPC.\\n10. After completion of investigation, the police laid charge sheet\\nagainst accused Nos.1 to 5 i.e., husband, mother-in-law, husband of sister-\\nin-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law of the deceased under Sections 498-\\nA and 306 IPC.\\n11. The trial Court after completion of required formalities and\\nbasing on prima facie material available, framed the charges for the offences\\nunder Sections 498-A and 306 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Act, 1961.5\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\n12. The accused pleaded not guilty for the said charges and prayed\\nthe trial Court to proceed with trial.\\n13. During trial, the prosecution has examined as many as 11\\nwitnesses, viz., PWs.1 to 11 and marked documents as Exs.P1 to P9. No\\noral evidence was adduced by the accused, however, marked the documents\\nExs.D1 to D4.\\n14. On completion of trial, the trial Court vide the impugned\\njudgment, acquitted accused Nos.1 to 5 for the charges under Sections 498-\\nA and 306 IPC and Section 3 of the Act and accused Nos.3 and 5 for the\\ncharge under Section 4 of the Act, 1961, while convicted accused Nos.1, 2\\nand 4 for the charge under Section 4 of the Act, 1961.\\n15. Aggrieved by the said conviction and imposition of sentence of\\nimprisonment, the appellants - accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 preferred the present\\nappeal.\\n16. It is relevant to note that neither the State nor the de facto\\ncomplainant preferred any appeal challenging the impugned judgment\\nacquitting accused Nos.1 to 5 for the charges under Sections 498-A and 306\\nIPC and accused Nos.3 and 5 for the charge under Section 4 of the Act,\\n1961.\\n17. Heard Mr. K. Surender, learned counsel for the appellants -\\naccused Nos.1, 2 and 4, and the learned Public Prosecutor for the\\nrespondent.6\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\n18. In view of the aforesaid fact-situation, the only question that falls\\nfor consideration before this Court is:\\n(i) Whether the conviction recorded by the trial Court\\nunder the impugned judgment against the appellants\\n- accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 for the charge under\\nSection 4 of the Act, 1961 is sustainable, both on\\nfacts and in law.\\n(ii) If not, to what relief they are entitled?\\n19. Impugning the judgment, the learned counsel for the appellants\\nhas raised an important legal issue. It is the contention of the learned\\ncounsel for the appellants that Section 4 of the Act, 1961 deals with penalty\\nfor demanding dowry, and as per which, if any person demands, directly or\\nindirectly, from the parents or other relatives or guardian of a bride or\\nbridegroom, as the case may be, any dowry, he shall be punishable with\\nimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months, but which\\nmay extend to two years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand\\nrupee: provided that the Court may, for adequate and special reasons to be\\nmentioned in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of\\nless than six months.\\n20. It is also contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that\\nSection 2 of the Act, 1961 deals with definition of “dowry”, and as per\\nwhich, ‘dowry’ means any property or valuable security given or agreed to\\nbe given either directly or indirectly (a) by one party to a marriage to the\\nother party to the marriage; or (b) by the parents of either party to a marriage\\nor by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person,\\nat or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of7\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nthe said parties, but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to\\nwhom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies. Explanation - I to the\\nsaid section was omitted. However, explanation - I refers the expression\\n“valuable security” has the same meaning as in Section 30 of the Indian\\nPenal Code (45 of 1860).\\n21. By referring the said provision, the learned counsel for the\\nappellants would contend that by way of amendment vide Act No.63 of 1984\\nw.e.f. 02.10.1985 the words “in connection with the marriage of the said\\nparties, but does not include” are added and, therefore, the alleged demand\\nof dowry should be in connection with the marriage of parties to attract\\npunishment under Section 4 of the Act. It is his further contention that by\\nvirtue of the above said amendment, the Parliament in its wisdom has\\nincorporated the words “in connection with the marriage of the said parties’\\nin the definition of ‘dowry’ defined under Section 2 of the Act, 1961.\\n22. By referring the above said two provisions of the Act i.e., ‘dowry’\\nand ‘penalty for demanding dowry’, the learned counsel for the appellants\\nwould submit that none of the witnesses deposed before the trial Court that\\nthe appellants - accused Nos.1,2 and 4 demanded the dowry in connection\\nwith the marriage of said parties. According to him, the marriage of accused\\nNo.1 with the deceased was held on 20.03.1992 and he is none other than\\nnephew of father of the deceased. According to him, even as per Ex.P1 -\\ncomplaint dated 27.07.2007 lodged by PW.1 (father of the deceased) that the\\nsaid marriage was an arranged one and at the time of marriage, he has\\nfulfilled all the formalities including providing an amount of Rs.10,000/-,\\n1½ toals gold and 10 toals of silver towards dowry.8\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\n23. It is further stated by PW.1 in the complaint that after marriage\\ntill they blessed with a son, accused have taken care of the deceased.\\nThereafter, accused have started harassing the deceased demanding\\nadditional dowry. He would further contend that it is also mentioned in\\nEx.P1 - report that the marriage of second daughter of PW.1 was settled and\\nhe went to the house of accused to invite them to his second daughter’s\\nmarriage. Then the accused demanded him to give dowry for attending the\\nmarriage of his second daughter and the accused have also informed PW.1\\nthat they would attend the marriage only in the event of paying additional\\ndowry as was agreed to give to the second daughter of PW.1 or else they\\nwould not attend. Upon which, PW.1 requested the accused that he was not\\nin a position to meet the said demand and requested them that he would pay\\nsome amount from his retirement benefits and requested them to attend the\\nmarriage. But, the accused did not attend the marriage. On the other hand,\\nthey have aggravated the deceased to further harassment and the deceased\\nattempted to commit suicide once. It is also stated in Ex.P1 that PW.1 has\\nretired and he has paid an amount of Rs.50,000/- to accused No.1 with a\\nrequest to take care of the welfare of his daughter. According to PW.1, both\\naccused No.1 and the deceased were lived happily for some time, but the\\naccused again started harassing the deceased.\\n24. As per Ex.P1, on 25.07.2007, accused No.1 called the son of\\nPW.1 i.e., PW.2 at about 7.00 p.m. and informed about missing of the\\ndeceased and enquired about whereabouts of the deceased. Thereafter,\\nPW.2 informed PW.1 about the same and they have searched for\\nwhereabouts of the deceased, but they could not trace her out. Again on\\n27.07.2007 at about 9.00 a.m. accused No.1 informed over phone about dead9\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nbody of the deceased found in nala at Ashok Nagar. Thereafter they have\\nreached there and identified the dead body.\\n25. The learned counsel for the appellants has also referred the\\ndeposition of PW.1 which is almost in the same lines of Ex.P1 complaint.\\nThe learned counsel for the appellants would also contend that PW.1 in his\\nchief-examination deposed as “A.1 demanded that as much dowry as was\\nagreed to be given to my 2nd daughter should be given to him also.” The\\nlearned counsel for the Appellants has also referred the certain admissions of\\nPW.1 during cross-examination which is as under:\\n“The retirement benefits were also paid through bank. I\\nwithdrew the P.F. amount after 3 months of my\\nretirement. I orally informed about the particulars to the\\npolice. I did not give any document relating to the\\npayment of Rs.50,000/- to the accused…..”\\n“It is true that I borrowed Rs.1,00,000/- from one\\nNarasimha Reddy and executed an agreement. But A.3\\ndid not stand as surety for the said loan. The signature\\nshown to me pertains to me. The agreement shown to\\nme, was executed by me. Ex.D.1 is the agreement. It is\\ntrue that Venkanna who was referred in Ex.D1 is no other\\nthan A.3…..”\\n“It is true that I did not state to the police that A.2 was\\nnot willing for the marriage from the beginning, but my\\nbrother-in-law was very particular and he also took a\\npromise from me regarding the same. The witness adds\\nthat due to the agony for the death of the deceased, we\\ndid not state the said fact to the police…..”\\n“It is true that I stated before the police that before the\\nmarriage I managed to provide a plot to A.1 from the\\nGovt. and after the marriage, A.1 gifted the said plot to\\nhis sister Hymavathi. The witness adds that even before10\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nthe court his version is the same. It is true that I did not\\nfile any document to show that the plot was registered in\\nthe name of A.1.”\\n26. The learned counsel for the appellants would further contend that\\nPW.2, brother of the deceased, also did not depose anything that the accused\\nhave demanded dowry in connection with the marriage. He also relied upon\\nthe deposition of PW.2 in chief-examination which is as under:\\n“A.1 expressed that we were giving Rs. one lakh as\\ndowry to our another sister whereas we gave only\\nRs.10,000/- to him and said that if we give one lakh to\\nhim they would attend the marriage. In spite of promise\\nof P.W.1 to give some money after the retirement, they\\nfailed to attend the marriage. They have continued the\\nharassment. On one occasion the deceased attempted\\nsuicide. P.W.1 retired in January, 2006 and we gave\\nRs.50,000/- in the month of March or April. They lived\\nhappily for one month, but again they started harassment.\\nThe only son of the deceased was also kept at Moulali in\\nthe house of A.4, only in order to harass the deceased.\\nThe deceased got mental depression and due to that\\nharassment only the deceased committed suicide.”\\n27. PW.2 during cross-examination categorically admitted that he has\\nbeen visiting the house of the accused from the date of marriage till her\\ndeath and they used to mutually visit their houses on special occasions.\\nThey used to attend all the functions mutually. They have also attended a\\nfunction held for L.W.5 Aravind Goud at the house of accused. PW.1 and\\nA.1 together wore Ayappa mala and went to Kerala. Even prior to the\\nmarriage they were related to the accused. The marriage of accused No.5\\nwas performed in 2006 and all of them attended the same. His second\\nsister’s marriage was performed in the year 1998. He has further admitted11\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nthat accused No.1 performed the funeral of deceased. PW.2 further admitted\\nduring cross-examination which is as under:\\n“I do not remember, whether I stated before the police,\\nthat A.1, A.2 and A.4 harassed the deceased for money\\nand that whenever I went to their house, I have taken\\npermission from A.4 and that A.1 expressed that we were\\ngiving Rs.1 lakh as dowry to our another sister where as\\nhe was given Rs.10,000/- only and that if we give 1 lakh\\nto him they would attend the marriage. The deceased was\\nnot taken to any hospital, when she attempted suicide\\nearlier. The witness adds that the matter was settled\\nbefore the elders.”\\n28. PW.3, son of the deceased and accused No.1 turned hostile.\\n29. PW.4, maternal uncle of the deceased also deposed in the same\\nlines as deposed by PW.1 and PW.2. During cross-examination, PW.4 has\\nadmitted that they have not given any complaint with regard to the alleged\\nharassment of deceased by the accused. However, he has further admitted\\nthat he has advised PW.1 to give a complaint, but PW.1 expressed that as the\\naccused are their relatives, compromise can be affected in the presence of\\nthe Corporator. PW.4 did not give any complaint against the accused.\\n30. PW.5, panch witness, deposed about conducting inquest on the\\ndead body of the deceased in his presence.\\n31. PW.6, Supervisor in St. Anthony High School, deposed about his\\nfinding the dead body in the nala and informing the same to the police.\\n32. PW.7, neighbour of the deceased, deposed about deceased\\nhanding over of keys to her on 25.7.2007 at about 4.00 p.m. and asking her12\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nto hand over the same to her family members whoever comes first. At about\\n5.00 p.m. accused No.2 came to the house and that she handed over the keys\\nto her. PW.7, during cross-examination, has admitted in the following\\nmanner:\\n“The neighbour of the accused on their left is one\\nMallesh, and one Dubba Raj is the neighbour on their\\nright. I have been residing in Basheerbagh in the said\\nlocality since 5 yrs. Myself and the deceased are\\nacquainted with each other and all on visiting terms. So\\nfar as I know, the deceased was living happily with the\\naccused. A.1, A.5, and their other Brother Ramesh reside\\nseparately though in the same premises. A.2 resides\\nalong with A.5. The family members of the deceased and\\nher relatives used to visit the house of the deceased, and\\nthe accused also used to attend the functions in the house\\nof the parents of the deceased. P.W.3 used to reside along\\nwith A.1 while the deceased was alive. The deceased\\nused to take him to the school every day.”\\n33. PW.11, S.I. of Police, Narayanaguda Police Station admitted in\\nhis cross-examination that he did not collect any document of plot which\\nwas stated by PW.1 and to show that accused No.1 gifted plot to his sister\\nand so also he did not collect any document for gold and other articles given\\nat the time of marriage. PW.11 further admitted that PW.1 did not state\\nbefore him that accused No.2 was not willing for marriage but his brother-\\nin-law was very particular and also took a promise from him regarding the\\nsame. He has further admitted that PW.2 did not state before him that\\naccused No.1 and 2 and 4 harassed the deceased for money and whenever he\\nwent to their house, he had to take permission from accused No.4 and\\naccused No.1 expressed that they were giving Rs.1 lakh as dowry to their13\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nanother sister, whereas he was given Rs.10,000/- only. PW.11 further\\ndeposed PW.4 did not state before him that PW.1 gave Rs.40,000/- after\\nretirement and accused No.1 refused the amount on the ground that it is\\ninsufficient and that then PW.1 gave Rs.50,000/- to accused No.1 and\\ndeceased tried to commit suicide and that PW.1 told him that he would seek\\nthe intervention of the councillor and the matter was conciliated.\\n34. By referring the above said depositions and admissions of\\nprosecution witnesses, the learned counsel for the appellants would contend\\nthat there was no demand of dowry by the appellants - accused Nos.1, 2 and\\n4 in connection with the marriage of the deceased with accused No.1. The\\nonly allegation made by PW.1, 2 and 4 is that the accused demanded\\nadditional dowry at the time of marriage of second daughter of PW.1 i.e.\\nsister of the deceased on the ground that PW.1 is giving dowry which is\\nmore than the dowry given to accused No.1 at the time of marriage.\\n35. Admittedly, the marriage of second daughter of PW.1 was\\nperformed in the year 1998, whereas the marriage of the deceased with\\naccused No.1 was performed on 20.03.1992. The deceased and accused\\nNo.1 were blessed with a son and he was aged about 14 years as on the date\\nof death of the deceased.\\n36. It is relevant to note that though police cited mother of the\\ndeceased as LW.2, they did not examine her before the trial Court. The\\nlearned counsel for the appellants by referring the same would contend that\\nnormally mother of the deceased will be in a position to tell the facts and she\\nwill be in a position to know the condition of her daughter and day-to-day\\nactivities and her whereabouts rather than father. The learned counsel for14\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nthe appellants would further contend that none of the witnesses including\\nPW.1, father of the deceased, PW.2, brother of the deceased, PW.4 maternal\\nuncle of the deceased, deposed about the alleged demand of dowry in\\nconnection with the marriage of the parties. Even, according to Ex.P1 and\\ndeposition of PWs.1, 2 and 4, the deceased and accused No.1 were lived\\nhappily till they were blessed with a son. As stated above, they blessed with\\na son and as on the date of death of deceased, son of the deceased and\\naccused No.1 was aged about 14 years.\\n37. It is also relevant to note that though it is stated in Ex.P1 - report\\nand as deposed by PW.1, PW.2 and PW.4 that the accused has taken care of\\nthe welfare of the deceased till she was blessed with a son and thereafter\\nstarted harassing the deceased for additional dowry both, mentally and\\nphysically. Even as per Ex.P1 and deposition of PWs.1, 2 and 4, the accused\\nhave demanded additional dowry at the time of marriage of second daughter\\nof PW.1 i.e. in the year 1998. Admittedly, the marriage of the deceased with\\naccused No.1 was held on 20.03.1992. None of the witnesses deposed about\\nany complaint given either to police or to any panchayat/conciliation\\nproceedings were held either before the elders or before well-wishers of both\\nparties. It is relevant to note that both the families of accused and PW.1 are\\nclosely related to each other. Accused No.1 is none other than nephew of\\nPW.1 i.e., sister’s son. The entire investigation and depositions of all the\\nwitnesses are silent with regard to any complaint given by PW.1 and his\\nfamily members and also conciliation or panchayat held before the well-\\nwishers and community elders. IN the absence of the same, it is highly\\ndifficult to believe that the accused demanded dowry from PW.1 and\\nharassed the deceased.15\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\n38. As rightly contended by the learned counsel for the appellants\\nthat by virtue of amendment vide Act No.63 of 1984 w.e.f. 02.10.1985, the\\nwords “in connection with the marriage of the said parties” are added and,\\ntherefore, the alleged demand of dowry should be in connection with the\\nmarriage of the said parties. Section 4 of the Act, 1961 also deals with\\n“penalty for demanding dowry’. Admittedly, in the present case, there is no\\ndemand of dowry in connection with the marriage of the parties viz.,\\ndeceased and accused No.1.\\n39. As discussed supra, the entire complaint lodged by PW.1 against\\nthe accused is that the accused have demanded additional dowry, more\\nparticularly, the dowry, which was given to the second daughter of PW.1 at\\nthe time of her marriage in the year 1998 i.e., six years after the marriage of\\nthe deceased. Even the said alleged demand of additional dowry at the time\\nof marriage of second daughter of PW.1 is also not proved with cogent\\nevidence.\\n40. It is relevant to note that the definition of ‘dowry’ under Section 2\\nof the Act, 1961 mere demand thereof would not be an offence under\\nSection 4 of the Act, 1961. It should either be given or agreed to be given at\\nor before or after the marriage in connection with the marriage. Although in\\ncommon parlance one very often uses the term “dowry demand” in the cases\\nwhere the husband or his relations demand valuable security from the\\nparents and other relations of the wife after the marriage, yet this will not\\namount to demand for dowry under the Act, 1961 in view of the definition of\\ndowry contained in Section 2 of the Act, 1961.16\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\n41. Demand for dowry under the Act and in the legal sense will mean\\nthe demand for dowry only when it refers to property of valuable security\\ngiven or agreed to be given at or before or after the marriage. The alleged\\noffence as made out in the complaint petition may attract the penal provision\\nas contained in Section 498-A IPC. The Parliament in its wisdom appended\\nthe explanation as to what “cruelty” means and has constructed sub-clause\\n(b) of Section 498-A in the following words, “harassment of the woman\\nwhere such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related\\nto her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or\\nis on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such\\ndemand.” If the cases of this nature are to be brought within the ambit of\\nSection 4 of the Act, 1961, then the word “dowry” under Section 2 of the\\nAct shall have to be redefined in the light of sub-clause (b) under Section\\n498-A IPC. The term “extortion demand” popularized by the Media may\\nalso find a place in the definition of dowry as observed by the Calcutta High\\nCourt in Sankar Prasad Shaw v. State1.\\n42. No doubt, the demand made subsequent to the marriage is also\\ncovered under the definition ‘dowry’, but the said demand should be in\\nconnection with the marriage. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kamesh\\nPanjiyar v. State of Bihar2 held that there are three occasions related to\\ndowry i.e., one is before the marriage, second is at the time of marriage and\\nthe third \"at any time\" after the marriage. The third occasion may appear to\\nbe unending period, but the crucial words are \"in connection with the\\nmarriage of the said parties\" but payments which are customary payments\\n1. 1991 Crl.L.J. 639 (Cal)\\n2. (2005) 2 SCC 38817\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nfor e.g. given at the time of birth of a child or other ceremonies as are\\nprevalent in different societies, are not covered by the expression \"dowry\".\\n43. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ashok Kumar v. State of\\nHaryana3 had an occasion to deal with the definition of ‘dowry’ under\\nSection 2 of the Act, 1961. In the said case, the Apex Court held that all the\\nexpressions used under Section 2 of the Act, 1961 are of a very wide\\nmagnitude. The expression “in connection with the marriage” cannot be\\ngiven a restricted or a narrower meaning. Even in common parlance and on\\nits plain language, it has to be understood generally. The object being that\\neverything which is offending at any time i.e. at, before or after the marriage\\nwould be covered under this definition, but the demand of dowry has to be\\n“in connection with the marriage”. “In connection with the marriage” is an\\nexpression which has to be given a wider connotation. However, the\\ndemand of dowry should not be so customary that it would not attract, on the\\nface of it, the provisions of this section. The customary payments given at\\nthe time of birth of a child or other ceremonies as are prevalent in the society\\nor families to the marriage would not be covered under the expression\\n“dowry”. But where the husband had demanded a specific sum from his\\nfather-in-law and upon not being given harassed and tortured the wife and\\nafter some days she died, such cases would clearly fall within the definition\\nof “dowry” under the Act.\\n44. The Hon’ble Supreme Court had also an occasion to deal with the\\ndefinition of ‘dowry’ in Reema Aggarwal v. Anupam4 and held that the\\ndefinition of the term “dowry” under Section 2 of the Act, 1961 shows that\\n3. (2010) 12 SCC 350\\n4. (2004) 3 SCC 19918\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nany property or valuable security given or “agreed to be given” either\\ndirectly or indirectly by one party to the marriage to the other party to the\\nmarriage “at or before or after the marriage” as a “consideration for the\\nmarriage of the said parties” would become “dowry” punishable under the\\nAct. Property or valuable security so as to constitute “dowry” within the\\nmeaning of the Act must be given or demanded “as consideration for the\\nmarriage”.\\n45. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in S. Gopal Reddy v. State of A.P.5\\nheld that Court’s approach should be realistic in dealing with a case under\\nthe Act. Provisions of the Act should interpreted in the light of the object of\\nthe Act so as to further that object but it being a penal statute Court should\\nbe cautious and careful so that suspicion, conjectures and surmise may not\\ninfluence its judgment. At the same time, it cannot acquit an accused merely\\non the basis of technicalities and minor discrepancies.\\n46. The Apex Court in Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana6 held\\nthat emphasis under Section 2 is on property or valuable security given “at\\nor before” or “ at any time after” marriage, in connection with marriage.\\nAmount or things demanded must, therefore, have a nexus with marriage.\\nWords “insufficient and inferior quality of dowry” are important. They\\nindicate that transaction of giving dowry was not complete.\\n47. The Apex Court also in Rajinder Singh v. State of Punjab7 held\\nthat the expression “ in connection with” would in the context of the social\\nevil sought to be tackled by the Act mean “in relation with” or “relating to”.\\nThus, any money or property or valuable security demanded by any of the\\n5. (1996) 4 SCC 596\\n6. (2014) 4 SCC 129\\n7. (2015) 6 SCC 47719\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\npersons mentioned in Section 2 of the Act, at or before or at any time after\\nthe marriage which is reasonably connected to the death of a married\\nwoman, would necessarily be in connection with or in relation to the\\nmarriage unless, the facts of a given case clearly and unequivocally point\\notherwise. Such giving or agreeing to give of any property or valuable\\nsecurity can be at any time. It can be at, before, or at any time after the\\nmarriage. Thus, it can be many years after a marriage is solemnized. The\\nHonble Supreme Court in M. Narayan v. State of Karnataka8 while\\ndealing with the definition of ‘dowry’ and following the principle held in\\nRajinder Singh7 held that any money or property or valuable security\\ndemanded by any of the persons mentioned in Section 2 of the Act, at or\\nbefore or at any time after the marriage which is reasonably connected to the\\ndeath of a married woman, would necessarily be in connection with or in\\nrelation to the marriage unless the facts of a given case clearly and\\nunequivocally point otherwise.\\n48. It is also relevant to note that the accused was initially charged\\nunder Section 498-A and 306 IPC and also Sections 3 and 4 of the Act,\\n1961. Section 498-A IPC, deals with husband or relative of husband of a\\nwoman subjecting her to cruelty. Section 306 IPC deals with abetment of\\nsuicide. Section 3 of the D.P. Act, 1961, deals with penalty for giving or\\ntaking dowry. The trial Court acquitted all the accused including the\\nappellants herein - accused Nos.1,2 and 4 for the offences under Section\\n498-A and 306 IPC and Section 3 of the Act, 1961. There is a finding given\\nby the trial Court that the deceased was not subjected to cruelty by the\\naccused and the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the\\n8. (2015) 6 SCC 46520\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\naccused are responsible for abetment of committing suicide by the deceased.\\nThe trial Court also acquitted all the accused under Section 3 of the Act,\\n1961 on the ground that there was no demand of dowry and there is no\\ntaking of dowry by them.\\n49. The trial Court convicted the appellants - accused Nos.1, 2 and 4\\nfor the offence under Section 4 of the Act, 1961 on the ground that demand\\nof additional dowry made by the accident Nos.1, 2 and 4 is cogently proved\\nby the prosecution. The trial Court despite giving a finding “in this case,\\nthough, it is doubtful as to whether any such demand was made with the\\ndeceased, no doubt, remains that dowry was demanded from Pw.1 by\\naccused Nos.1, 2 and 4, held that Nos.1, 2 and 4 have demanded additional\\ndowry. The trial Court recorded conviction relying upon the judgment of the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. V. Raj Gopal\\nAsawa9, but the facts in the said decision are altogether different from the\\nfacts of the present case. In the said case, it is held by the Hon’ble Supreme\\nCourt held that demand neither conceives nor would conceive any\\nagreement. The word ‘agreement’ referred to in Section 2 of the Act has to\\nbe inferred on the facts and circumstances of each case. The interpretation\\nthat conviction can only be if there is agreement for dowry is misconceived\\nand is contrary to the mandate and the object of the Act. It was further held\\nby the Hon’ble Apex Court that it is not necessary that there should always\\nbe an agreement for dowry. As discussed supra, in the present case, there is\\nno agreement for dowry and there is no demand of dowry at all. Therefore,\\nthe facts of the present case are altogether different to the facts and the\\nprinciple held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the aforesaid decision. The\\n9. 2004 (1) ALD (Crl) 642 (SC)21\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\ntrial Court gave a finding that “However the evidence gives an\\nunderstanding that some of the accused developed greed for additional\\ndowry as more dowry was given to the sister of the deceased. But the\\nprosecution could not prove that the accused subjected the deceased to\\ncruelty and harassment with a demand of money, hence no offence under\\nsection 498-A IPC can be held as proved.”\\n50. As stated supra, despite the above said finding, the trial Court\\nconvicted the appellants - accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 for the offence under\\nSection 4 of the Act, 1961. There is no specific finding given by the trial\\nCourt with regard to the alleged demand of dowry by the appellants in\\nconnection with the marriage of the parties. At the cost of repetition, as\\ndiscussed supra, the alleged demand of dowry by the accused is at the time\\nof marriage of second daughter of PW.1. The said alleged demand is also\\nnot in connection with the marriage of the parties herein viz., the deceased\\nand accused No.1. the trial Court having acquitted all the accused for the\\noffences under Sections 498-A, 306 IPC and Section 3 of the Act, 1961,\\nshould not have convicted the appellants under Section 4 of the Act, 1961\\ndespite there is a specific finding that the prosecution failed to prove the\\ndemand of additional dowry or harassment or cruelty.\\n51. In view of the above said discussion, the conviction recorded by\\nthe trial Court under Section 4 of the Act, 1961 against the appellants -\\naccused Nos.1, 2 and 4 is unsustainable, both on the facts and in law. It is\\nalso relevant to note that the prosecution failed to prove that the appellants\\nhave demanded dowry in connection with the marriage of the deceased with\\naccused No.1 beyond reasonable doubt. It is further relevant to note that the\\nmarriage of accused No.1 with the deceased was held on 20.03.1992 and22\\nKL,J\\nCrl.A. No.1284 of 2008\\nthey were blessed with a son, who was aged about 15 years as on the date of\\ngiving evidence as PW.3 before the trial Court and he is now 27 years old.\\nAccording to him (PW.3), he is staying with his father from childhood. It is\\nalso settled principle of the Apex Court in a catena of decisions time and\\nagain that right to live is a fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen under\\nArticle 21 of the Constitution of the India. Therefore, the Court should\\ncautious while recording conviction against accused which would defeat the\\nsaid right guaranteed to the citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution of\\nIndia. The Courts should record conviction in the event of prosecution\\nproving the offence beyond reasonable doubt. Coming to the case on hand,\\nas discussed supra, the prosecution miserable failed to prove the demand of\\ndowry as defined under Section 2 of the Act, 1961, more particularly, in\\nconnection with the marriage between the deceased and accused No.1 and,\\ntherefore, the appellants - accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 are entitled for acquittal.\\n52. In view of the above discussion, the impugned judgment dated\\n14.10.2008, passed by the V Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge\\n(Mahila Court) at Hyderabad in Sessions Case No.253 of 2008, convicting\\nthe appellants - accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 for the offence under Section 4 of the\\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961 is hereby set aside and accordingly, they are\\nacquitted. They are on bail. Their bail bonds shall stand cancelled.\\nThe present Criminal Appeal is accordingly allowed. As a sequel,\\nmiscellaneous applications, if any, pending in the appeal shall stand closed.\\n_______________________\\nJUSTICE K. LAKSHMAN\\n24th April , 2020\\nNote: L.R.

Basing on the confessional\\nstatement of accused No.4, the police have added the section of law i.e.,\\n307 and 434 IPC to the existing sections of law.\\n3. As per the complaint, the allegations are as follows:\\n(a) One Jagannadh Reddy is the pattedar of land admeasuring\\nAc.33-00 guntas in Survey No.885 (old) 696 (new), situated at Janwada\\nVillage of Shankarpally Mandal. The said Jagannadh Reddy has\\nexecuted a General Power of Attorney in favour of one Mr.Ramchandra\\nSingh in respect of the said land of Ac.33-00 guntas. The said\\nRamchandra Singh, by virtue of the said General Power of Attorney sold\\nland admeasuring Ac.4-00 guntas, out of Ac.33-00 guntas, under aKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n3\\nRegistered Document bearing No.15038/1990 to the 1st\\nrespondent/complainant. After purchase of the said land, the 1st\\nrespondent/complainant has constructed a room in the year 1998 in the\\nsaid land and used to visit the said land frequently and used to do\\nagricultural activities in the said land. The said Ramchandra Singh sold\\nland admeasuring Ac.4-00 guntas, in the remaining land, to one\\nS.Shankar through a Registered Document bearing No.3336 of 1991. In\\nthe year 2015, the said Shankar gave the said Ac.4-00 guntas of land to\\nthe 1st respondent/complainant through unregistered working General\\nPower of Attorney.\\n(b) Accused persons by name Dilip Reddy, Pradeep Reddy,\\nN.Krishna Kumari and Kiran Reddy, legal heirs of the said patteddar\\nJagannadh Reddy, upon knowing that their father has executed General\\nPower Attorney in favour of Mr. Ramchandra Singh vide Document\\nbearing No.2546 of 1990, with a deceitful intention, after the death of\\ntheir father Jagannadh Reddy, claiming themselves to be the legal heirs\\nof the said Ac.33-00 guntas of land, made double registration through\\nAgreement-cum-Sale and General Power of Attorney vide Document\\nbearing No.6242 of 2005 to Sriven Construction Company and cheated\\nthe 1st respondent/complainant. The said Sriven Construction Company,\\nin the year 2007, sold the said land to one Ravinder Reddy i.e., the 1st\\npetitioner/accused No.5. Accused including the 1st petitioner are\\nresidents of Kollur Village, Medak District, and his Manager, Bhaskar\\nRao (wrongly mentioned as Bhaskar Reddy) the 2nd petitioner/accused\\nNo.6 along with their henchmen are trying to encroach the 1st\\nrespondent’s land from the year 2018 and threatened him on several\\noccasions to vacate his land and also damaged the iron walls in the land\\nin the year 2007.

Krishna Murthy, learned Senior Counsel representing\\nSri N. Ravi Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that\\nthe 1st petitioner, partner of M/s.One and Cadol Developers, has entered\\ninto a Registered Development Agreement-cum-General Power of\\nAttorney with Smt. Satwant Kaur W/o Sri Balvinder Singh, for\\ndevelopment of said land admeasuring Ac.8-00 guntas, out of total land\\nadmeasuring Ac.12-07 guntas, forming part of Survey Nos.273 and 274\\nsituated at Kollur Village, Ramchandrapuram Mandal, Sangareddy\\nDistrict, on the terms and conditions specifically mentioned therein.\\nThey have also obtained permission from HMDA vide proceedings, dated\\n02.02.2021. Pursuant to the said permission, the said Firm is\\nproceeding with development of the said land.\\n5(i). Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that when the 1st\\nrespondent and another is trying to interfere with the possession of land\\nof Smt.Satwant Kaur, who is owner and M/s. One and Cadol Developers,\\ndevelopers of the said land, they have filed a suit in O.S.No.656 of 2019\\non the file of Principal Junior Civil Judge, Medak District at Sangareddy,\\nagainst the 1st respondent and others for Perpetual Injunction. In the\\nsaid suit, the 1st respondent herein has entered his appearance and filed\\nI.A.No.2478 of 2019 in O.S.No.656 of 2019 seeking to reject the plaint on\\nthe ground that the Principal Junior Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate\\nof First Class, Sangareddy, has no jurisdiction to entertain the said suit.\\nThe said application was dismissed vide, order, dated 20.01.2020. By\\nreferring to the said order, learned Senior Counsel would submit that the\\n1st respondent knowingly suppressed the fact of pendency of aforesaid\\nsuit and also the order passed by the Court below in dismissing the\\napplication filed by him seeking rejection of the plaint.\\n5 (ii). Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that when there\\nwas a dispute with regard to the overlapping of survey numbers of two\\nvillages i.e., Janwada and Kollur, a joint survey was conducted andKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n6\\nproceedings, dated 04.04.2019, were issued. As per the said\\nproceedings, land in Survey Nos.273/AA, 274/A1/1, 274/A2/2\\nadmeasuring Ac.8-00 guntas, is falling in Kollur Village,\\nRamchandrapuram Mandal, Sangareddy District. Basing on the said\\nreport only, the HMDA granted approval to the said Firm on 02.02.2021.\\nEven then, the 1st respondent with a mala fide intention, during penency\\nof the said suit, lodged the present complaint implicating the petitioners\\nherein in a false case, and thus, the 1st respondent is trying to\\ncriminalize the civil proceedings. According to learned Senior Counsel,\\nthe 1st respondent, instead of waiting for result of the said suit, has\\nlodged the present complaint with a mala fide intention. There are\\ncontradictions in the complaint, statement of the 1st respondent /\\ncomplainant recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. and also in the\\nremand report. He would further submit that the 1st respondent did not\\nmention about the pendency of the said suit and the order dated\\n20.01.2020 in the complaint dated 20.02.2021. Thus, there is\\nsuppression of fact. Therefore, the learned senior counsel would submit\\nthat the 1st respondent has implicated the petitioners herein in a false\\ncase and at the instance of the 1st respondent, the police are harassing\\nboth the petitioners herein. According to him, the contents of the\\ncomplaint dated 20.02.2021, the statements of the witnesses recorded\\nunder Section 161 of Cr.P.C. lacks the ingredients of the offences alleged\\nagainst the petitioners herein. With the said contentions, learned Senior\\nCounsel sought to quash the proceedings in Crime No.175 of 2021\\npending on the file of Narsingi Police Station against the petitioners.\\n6. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the\\n1st respondent/complainant would submit that the 1st respondent is\\nowner of land admeasuring Ac.4-00 guntas in Survey No.885 (old) 696\\n(new) and he has purchased the said land from one Ramchandra Singh\\nin the year 1990 itself. The said Ramchandra Singh also sold landKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n7\\nadmeasuring Ac.4-00 guntas, out of the remaining land, to one\\nS.Shankar through document bearing No.3336 of 1991, there upon the\\n1st respondent acquired the said land from the said Shanker in the year\\n1991 through unregistered working General Power of Attorney. Thus, in\\nall, the 1st respondent is owner of Ac.8.00 guntas of land in Survey No.\\n696 (new) 885 (old). The petitioners herein and other accused, who are\\nhaving money and muscle power, taking advantage of the age of the 1st\\nrespondent, are trying to encroach upon the said land. In the said\\ncourse of action, they have trespassed into the land of the 1st respondent\\non 20.02.2021, damaged the room and threatened the 1st respondent to\\nvacate the said land. They have also taken away the agricultural related\\ntools. According to the learned counsel for the 1st respondent /\\ncomplainant, there are specific allegations in the complaint, which is at\\ninvestigation stage, the proceedings in Crime No.175/2021 many not be\\nquashed at the initial stage. With the said submissions, learned counsel\\nfor the 1st respondent sought to dismiss the present petition.\\n7. Learned Public Prosecutor would submit that the police, on receipt\\nof complaint from the 1st respondent, since the contents of the complaint\\nconstitute cognizable offence, registered a case in Crime No.175 of 2021\\nfor the aforesaid offences against the petitioners and other accused.\\nDuring the course of investigation, the police have recorded the\\nstatement of three witnesses. According to the learned Public\\nProsecutor, the investigation is pending and the petitioners are not\\ncooperating with the Investigating Officer in concluding the case.\\nPetitioner No.2/accused No.6 was arrested and he was enlarged on bail.\\nWith the said submissions, learned Public Prosecutor sought to dismiss\\nthe present application.\\n8. The above stated rival submissions would reveal that the 1st\\npetitioner is claiming to be the partner of M/s. One and Cadol\\nDevelopers. As per the Development Agreement-cum-General Power ofKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n8\\nAttorney bearing document bearing No.18975 of 2018, dated 21.05.2018,\\nthe 1st petitioner has taken the land admeasuring Ac.8-00 guntas in\\nSurvey Nos.273 and 274 situated at Kollur Village, Ramchandrapuram\\nMandal, Sangareddy District, from its owner Smt. Satwant Kaur for\\ndevelopment. The owner of the land and Firm have also obtained\\npermission from HMDA vide proceedings, dated 02.02.2021. It is also\\nnot in dispute that when there was dispute with regard to overlapping of\\nsurvey numbers, a joint survey was conducted and the Revenue\\nDivisional Officer, Sangareddy Division, has issued proceedings, dated\\n04.04.2019, stating that the land in Survey Nos.273 and 274\\nadmeasuring Ac.8-00 guntas is falling in Kollur Village,\\nRamchandrapuram Mandal, Sangareddy District.\\n9. It is relevant to note that the said Smt. Satwant Kaur, owner,\\nM/s. One and Cadol Developers, developers of the said land, have filed\\nsuit in O.S.No.656 of 2019 on the file of Principal Junior Civil Judge,\\nSangareddy, for Perpetual Injunction against the 1st respondent and\\nothers. The 1st respondent has entered his appearance, filed Written\\nStatement and also filed Interlocutory Application vide I.A.No.2478 of\\n209 under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C seeking to reject the plaint. The\\nsame was dismissed by the Court below vide order, dated 20.01.2020.\\nThe 1st respondent has suppressed the said facts in his complaint, dated\\n20.02.2021. There is no explanation, much less plausible explanation\\nfrom the 1st respondent for suppression of relevant information in the\\ncomplaint.\\n10. Admittedly, the suit in O.S.No.656 of 2019 filed by the owner and\\nthe developers against the 1st respondent and others is pending. In the\\norder, dated 20.01.2020, in I.A.No.2478 of 2019 in O.S.No.656 of 2019\\nfiled under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. to reject the plaint, the Court below\\ngave a specific finding that the lands in Kollur Village and the lands in\\nJanwada Village are side by side and Survey No.297 of Kollur Village wasKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n9\\noverlapped with the lands in Janwada village. The proceedings of the\\nDistrict Collector does not show whether the suit schedule property in\\nSurvey Nos. 273 and 274 are overlapping with the lands in Janwada\\nVillage. In such circumstances, the Court below, by relying upon the\\ndocuments filed by the plaintiffs at the time of institution of suit, which\\ndiscloses that the suit schedule property is situated within the territorial\\njurisdiction of the Court, dismissed the said application. Though the 1st\\nrespondent has suffered the said order, failed to mention about the same\\nand also pendency of the suit in the complaint. Thus, there is\\nsuppression of material facts by the 1st respondent/complainant in the\\ncomplaint, dated 20.02.2021.\\n11. In the complaint itself, the 1st respondent has specifically\\nmentioned that in the year 2007, the Collectors of both Ranga Reddy\\nDistrict and Medak District have conducted survey to decide the\\njurisdiction and demarcation of the respective Districts and the then\\nDistrict Collector, Ranga Reddy District, vide proceedings, dated\\n05.02.2007, has stated that the said land is in topography of the Ranga\\nReddy District and also gave No Objection Certificate to 1st respondent.\\nHaving stated so, the 1st respondent suppressed about the pendency of\\naforesaid suit in the complaint and also filing of application under Order\\nVII Rule 11 CP.C., seeking rejection of the plaint in the said suit.\\n12. The only allegation against the 1st petitioner is that as per his\\ninstructions, the 2nd petitioner/accused No.6, his Manager and other\\naccused have criminally trespassed into the land of respondent No.1\\nalong with JCB vehicle without number plate. Except that allegation,\\nthere is no other allegation against the 1st petitioner. There is no\\nallegation against the 1st petitioner herein that he has intention to kill\\nthe 1st respondent. There is also no allegation against the 2nd\\npetitioner/A6 that he had intention to kill the 1st respondent andKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n10\\naccordingly attempted to kill him. The only allegation against the 2nd\\npetitioner/A6 is that he has trespassed into the said land.\\n13. The 1st respondent has filed a counter on 08.03.2021 in the\\npresent criminal petition. The learned Public Prosecutor has filed copy of\\nFIR along with complaint, alternation memo, remand case diary,\\nstatements of witnesses recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. and\\nconfessional statement and recovery panchanama of the 2nd petitioner /\\naccused No.6. As stated above, the 1st respondent gave complaint to the\\npolice on 20.02.2021 at 18:30 hours. According to him, the incident\\ntook place at about 6.30 p.m. In the complaint, he has stated that the 2nd\\npetitioner / A-6 along with his men trespassed into the land on the\\ninstructions of the 1st petitioner / A-5 along with JCB without number\\nplate. Even in the complaint also, the allegation made by the 1st\\nrespondent is that the petitioners herein have tried to grab the land\\nadmeasuring Acs.33.00 including his land and they have threatened /\\ndire consequences. So that he left the land. Thus, there is no allegation\\nagainst the petitioners herein that they have tried to kill the 1st\\nrespondent herein. There is no allegation in the said complaint dated\\n20.02.2021 that the petitioners herein have done any act with an\\nintention or knowledge and under such circumstances, the said act\\ncaused death and in the statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C.\\nA perusal of compliant dated 20.02.2021 would reveal that the Station\\nHouse Officer, Narsingi Police Station, has received the said complaint on\\n20.02.2021 at 20:00 hours, and there is a specific endorsement to the\\nsaid effect and investigation was entrusted to Mr.Lakshman, S.I. of\\nPolice. The said Investigating Officer has recorded the statement of 1st\\nrespondent on 20.02.2021 itself. In the said statement, the Investigating\\nOfficer did not mention the time at which he has recorded the statement\\nof the 1st respondent. It is relevant tonote that though the Investigating\\nOfficer has mentioned that he has recorded the statement of the 1stKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n11\\nrespondent on 20.02.2021 and at his signature, he has mentioned the\\ndate as “28.02.2021”. There is improved version in the said statement.\\nThe 1st respondent in his statement under section 161 of Cr.P.C. stated\\nthat he is in possession of the said land and the accused has trespassed\\ninto the land and tried to occupy the said land by killing the 1st\\nrespondent / complainant. Surprisingly, he has also mentioned the\\nname of LW.3, Irfan Khan, and there is also mention about the 1st\\nrespondent / de facto complainant making call to “100 dial”. Thereafter,\\nthe accused have left the said place along with the said JCB and Tractors\\non observing that the police are coming to the spot. Thus, there is\\nimproved version in the said statement recorded under section 161\\nCr.P.C. and there are contradictions in the statement of the 1st\\nrespondent / complainant recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. and in the\\ncomplaint. It is relevant to mention that the 1st respondent did not\\nmention about the presence of LW.1 i.e., Palloth Linga Naik either in the\\ncomplaint or in the statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C.\\nWhereas, in the statement of the said Linga Naik (LW.2), it is specifically\\nmentioned by him that he was there in his land on 20.02.2021. Though\\nthe Investigating Officer mentioned the date of examination of LW.2 as\\n21.02.2021, he has mentioned about the date after his signature as\\n“28.02.2021”. There is contradiction with the version of LW.1 (de facto\\ncomplainant) and LW.2. It is also relevant to note that the Investigating\\nOfficer has mentioned the date of examination of LW.3 as 21.02.2021\\nand in the said statement, LW.3 has stated that the incident took place\\nat 4.00 p.m. and also that the JCB is without number plate. He has not\\nmentioned about the presence of LW.2. He has stated that he has taken\\nphotograph of the said incident and gave it to the de facto complainant.\\nIt is also relevant to mention that in the said statement LW.3 has stated\\nthat he has dictated the statement in English and the police have\\nrecorded the same in Telugu and thereafter he signed it. He has also\\nmentioned about the de facto complainant making complaint to dial 100.KL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n12\\n14. A perusal of the alteration memo would also reveal that though on\\nthe said alteration memo, the Investigating Officer has mentioned the\\ndate as 21.02.2021, after his signature he has mentioned the date as\\n“28.02.2021”. The Investigating Officer has filed the said alteration\\nmemo before the XVI Additional Metropolitan Magistrate, Cyberabad at\\nRajendranagar on 28.02.2021 and there is an endorsement to the said\\neffect. The said Magistrate Court has given the inward number as “In\\n1221/21/1.3.21”. The application for remand filed by the Investigating\\nOfficer would reveal that they have arrested the 2nd petitioner / accused\\nNo.4 on 27.02.2021 and they have produced him before the learned\\nMagistrate on 28.02.2021. In the alteration memo, it is mentioned that\\nduring the course of investigation, the Investigating Officer has examined\\nand recorded the statement of the 1st respondent in detail, other\\nwitnesses concerned and incorporated the same in Part-II Case diary. He\\nhas visited the scene of offence, conducted scene of offence panchanama.\\nAs per the statements of the witnesses, the section of law 307, 434 IPC\\nwas established. Therefore, the alternation memo is filed before the\\nCourt. At the cost of repetition, it is relevant to mention that the\\nNarsingi Police Station, Investigating Officer in Crime No.175 of 2021,\\nmentioned the date of alteration memo as 21.02.2021, after his signature\\nhe has mentioned the date as 28.02.2021 and the said alteration memo\\nwas filed before the learned Magistrate on 28.02.2021, who in turn given\\nthe inward number on 01.03.2021. It is also relevant to mention that\\nthe 1st respondent has filed counter in the present criminal petition\\nwherein at paragraph Nfo.11, it is mentioned that on 20.02.2021, 1st\\npetitioner, his Manager, 2nd petitioner, criminally trespassed into his\\nland with JCB “JCB 7UJ 0915”. Whereas, in the complaint and the\\nstatements recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., 1st respondent and\\nother witnesses mentioned that the JCB was without number plate.\\nThus, there are contradictions in the versions of the 1st respondent and\\nLW.2 and LW.3. There are improved versions in the same.KL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n13\\n15. As stated above, admittedly, the suit in O.S.No.656 of 2019 is\\npending between the parties. The 1st respondent, instead of waiting for\\nthe result of the said suit, lodged the present complaint with an\\nallegation that the 1st petitioner is trying to encroach into his land and in\\nthe said course of action, as per the instructions of the 1st petitioner, the\\nother accused have trespassed into his land. Thus, admittedly, civil\\ndisputes are pending between the parties.\\n16. Section 420 I.P.C deals with punishment for cheating. As per\\nwhich, whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person\\ndeceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or\\ndestroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is\\nsigned or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable\\nsecurity. Whereas, in the present case, there is no allegation of\\ninducement more particularly, dishonest inducement against the\\npetitioners herein by the 1st respondent in the complaint, dated\\n20.02.2021. Thus, the contents of complaint lack the ingredients of the\\noffence under Section 420 I.P.C.\\n17. Section 441 I.P.C deals with criminal trespass. As per which,\\nwhoever enters into or upon property in possession of another with\\nintent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person\\nin possession of such property or having lawfully entered into or upon\\nsuch property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to\\nintimidate, insult or annoy any such or with intent thereby to intimidate,\\ninsult or annoy any such person or with intent to commit an offence.\\n18. Section 447 I.P.C. deals with punishment for criminal trespass.\\nSection 427 I.P.C deals with punishment of Mischief causing damage to\\nthe amount of fifty rupees.KL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n14\\n19. Section 307 IPC deals with attempt to murder, and as per which,\\nwhoever does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such\\ncircumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder,\\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may\\nextend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any\\nperson by such act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or\\nto such punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned.\\n20. Section 434 IPC deals with mischief by destroying or moving, etc., a\\nland-mark fixed by public authority, and as per which, whoever commits mischief\\nby destroying or moving any land-mark fixed by the authority of a public servant,\\nor by any act which renders such land-mark less useful as such, shall be punished\\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year,\\nor with fine, or with both.\\n21. A perusal of the complaint would reveal that there is no allegation,\\nmuch less specific allegation against the 1st petitioner/accused No.5 that\\nhe criminally trespassed into the land of the 1st respondent. In the\\ncomplaint dated 20.02.2021, it is alleged that as per the instructions of\\n1st petitioner, the 2nd petitioner and other accused have trespassed into\\nthe land of the 1st respondent. As discussed supra, there is no allegation\\nin the complaint dated 20.02.2021 that the 1st petitioner attempted to\\nmurder the 1st respondent / de facto complainant. There is no such\\nallegation even against the 2nd petitioner. It is alleged that they have\\nthreatened / dire consequences the de facto complainant. As stated\\nabove, the possession of the 1st respondent over the land claimed by the\\n1st petitioner itself is in dispute. Smt. Satwant Kaur is claiming that she\\nis owner of land admeasuring Ac.8-00 guntas in Survey Nos.273 and 274\\nof Kollur Village and M/s. One and Cadol Developers, represented by the\\n1st petitioner, partner of the said firm, is claiming that it is a registered\\ndevelopment holder-cum-General Power of Attorney in respect of the saidKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n15\\nland. They have also filed proceedings, dated 02.02.2021 issued by the\\nHMDA. Vide proceedings, dated 04.04.2019, the Revenue Divisional\\nOfficer, Sangareddy District, specifically mentioned that the land in\\nSurvey Nos.273 and 274 is falling in Kollur Village, Ramchandrapuram\\nMandal, Sangareddy District. Thus, the possession of the 1st respondent\\nover the said land itself is in dispute. Admittedly, the suit in O.S.No.656\\nof 2019 is pending. Interlocutory Application filed by the 1st respondent\\nseeking to reject the plaint was dismissed by the Court below specifically\\nreferring to the proceedings issued by the District Collector, Ranga Reddy\\nDistrict, whereunder it is mentioned that the lands in Kollour Village and\\nthe lands in Janwada Village are side by side. The land in Survey\\nNo.279 of Kollur Village is overlapping with the land in Janwada Village.\\nThe proceedings of the District Collector, Ranga Reddy District does not\\nshow whether the suit schedule property i.e., land in Survey Nos.273\\nand 274 are overlapping with the lands of Janwada Village. Thus, from\\nthe said finding, the Court below has dismissed the application filed by\\nthe 1st respondent seeking to reject the plaint in O.S.No.659 of 2019.\\nAdmittedly, the said suit is pending. The 1st respondent has suppressed\\nthe said facts in his complaint, dated 20.02.2021.\\n22. The Hon’ble Apex Court in a judgment reported in Sardar Ali\\nKhan v. State of Uttar Pradesh1 has categorically held that when Civil\\nCourt ceased of the very same issue, allowing the criminal proceedings to\\ncontinue without any criminal element, would be nothing but abuse of\\nprocess of law and the proceedings in the said crime are liable to be\\nquashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\\n23. In Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India Limited2, the Apex\\nCourt held that “while on the issue, it is necessary to take notice of a\\ngrowing tendency in business circles to convert purely civil disputes into\\n1. (2020) 12 SCC 51\\n2. (2006) 6 SCC 736KL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n16\\ncriminal cases. This is obviously on account of a prevalent impression\\nthat civil law remedies are time consuming and do not adequately protect\\nthe interests of lenders/creditors. Such a tendency is seen in several\\nfamily disputes also, leading to irretrievable break down of\\nmarriages/families. There is also an impression that if a person could\\nsomehow be entangled in a criminal prosecution, there is likelihood of\\nimminent settlement. Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which\\ndo not involve any criminal offence, by applying pressure through\\ncriminal prosecution should be deprecated and discouraged.\\n24. The Hon‘ble Apex Court in Paramajeet Batra v. State of\\nUttarakhand3, held that when a dispute essentially of a civil nature is\\ngiven the cloak of criminal offence and if a civil remedy is available, the\\nHigh Court should not hesitate to quash the criminal proceedings to\\nprevent abuse of process of Court.\\n25. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal4, the Apex Court cautioned\\nthat power of quashing should be exercised very sparingly and\\ncircumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases. The Apex Court\\nin the said judgment laid down certain guidelines/parameters for\\nexercise of powers under Section - 482 of Cr.P.C., which are as under:\\n\"(1) Where the allegations made in the first information\\nreport or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face\\nvalue and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie\\nconstitute any offence or make out a case against the\\naccused.\\n(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and\\nother materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not\\ndisclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by\\npolice officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except\\nunder an order of a Magistrate within the purview of\\nSection 155(2) of the Code.\\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or\\ncomplaint and the evidence collected in support of the same\\ndo not disclose the commission of any offence and make out\\na case against the accused.\\n3. (2013) 11 SCC 673\\n4. 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335KL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n17\\n(4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a\\ncognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable\\noffence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer\\nwithout an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under\\nSection 155(2) of the Code.\\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are\\nso absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which\\nno prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that\\nthere is sufficient ground for proceeding against the\\naccused.\\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of\\nthe provisions of the Code or the Act concerned (under\\nwhich a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution\\nand continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a\\nspecific provision in the Code or Act concerned, providing\\nefficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.\\n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with\\nmala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously\\ninstituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance\\non the accused and with a view to spite him due to private\\nand personal grudge.\"\\n26. This Court vide order, dated 18.01.2021, in Crl.P.No.3276 of 2020\\nby referring to the pendency of three applications under Section 9 of the\\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, wherein adjudication was sought with\\nregard to the interpretation of conditions of LLP Agreement and violation,\\nthereby held that the proceedings in the said crime are liable to the\\nquashed and the Investigating Officer is not having power to proceed\\nwith the said issue by conducting investigation under the provisions of\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure and that the Court does not permit the\\nInvestigating Officer to do so.\\n27. In view of law laid down by the Apex Court and this Court in the\\nJudgments cited supra, coming to the facts on hand, as discussed supra,\\nadmittedly, the suit in O.S.No.659 of 2019 is pending. The 1st petitioner,\\ndeveloper and owner of the said land are claiming that the land\\nadmeasuring Ac.8-00 guntas is situated in Survey Nos.273 and 274 of\\nKollur Village, Ramchandrapuram Mandal, Sangareddy District.\\nWhereas the 1st respondent is claiming that the said land is situated inKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n18\\nSurvey No.855 (old) 696 (new) of Janwada Village, Shankarpally Mandal,\\nRanga Reddy District.\\n28. The 1st respondent is relying upon the proceedings, dated\\n05.02.2007 issued by the District Collector, Ranga Reddy District,\\nwhereas the 1st petitioner is relying upon the proceedings, dated\\n04.04.2019 issued by the Revenue Divisional Officer, Sanga Reddy\\nDistrict. Both the 1st petitioner and the 1st respondent are claiming that\\nthere was dispute with regard to overlapping of lands in the said two\\nvillages i.e., Kollur and Janwada. The said dispute was resolved by way\\nof conducting joint survey by both District Collectors i.e., Sangareddy\\nDistrict and Ranga Reddy District. However, the said matter is subject\\nmatter of suit in O.S.No.659 of 2019. The 1st respondent cannot expect a\\nfinding or adjudication of the said issue, which is civil in nature, which\\ninvolves complicated questions of fact by the Investigating Officer in\\nCrime No.175 of 2021. The Investigating Officer under the Code of\\nCriminal Procedure is not having power to decide such complicated\\nquestions of fact, which the jurisdictional competent Civil Court alone\\ncan decide.\\n29. Admittedly, in the present case, the suit in O.S.No.659 of 2019 is\\npending and the Civil Court ceased the very same issue. As stated\\nabove, there are contradictions, improved versions and laches in\\nconducting the investigation including dates as discussed supra.\\nTherefore, allowing the criminal proceedings to continue without there\\nbeing any criminal element is not permissible and it amounts to abuse of\\nprocess of law.\\n30. At the cost of repetition, it is relevant to note that the 1st\\nrespondent has suppressed the fact of pendency of aforesaid suit and\\nfiling of Interlocutory Application under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C for\\nrejection of plaint, which was dismissed by the Court below and it is aKL,J\\ncrlp_1554_2021\\n19\\ncontest order. As discussed above, the only allegation in the complaint is\\nthat on the instructions of the 1st petitioner, the 2nd petitioner trespassed\\ninto the subject land. As discussed above, the possession of the 1st\\npetitioner over the subject land is in dispute and the above said suit is\\npending. The contents of the complaint lacks the ingredients of the\\nSections 307, 434, 420, 447, 427 and 506 read with 34 IPC. There is no\\ninducement of the 1st respondent by the petitioners. Even then, Narsingi\\nPolice Station has registered the above said crime for the aforesaid\\noffences. Thus, according to this Court, the proceedings in Crime No.175\\nof 2021 against the petitioners herein cannot be continued. This Court\\nis inclined to quash the proceedings in Crime No.175 of 2021 pending on\\nthe file of Narsingi police station against the petitioners by invoking its\\ninherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\\n31. Accordingly, the Criminal Petition is allowed quashing the\\nproceedings in Crime No.175 of 2021 of Narsingi Police Station,\\nCyberabad Commissionerate, against the present petitioners/accused\\nNos.5 and 6 only.\\nMiscellaneous petitions, if any, pending shall stand closed.\\n__________________\\nK.

              " 'THE HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE HIMA KOHLI\\nAND\\nTHE HON’BLE SRI JUSTICE B. VIJAYSEN REDDY\\nF.C.A. No.127 OF 2015\\nJUDGMENT: (Per the Hon’ble the Chief Justice Hima Kohli)\\n1. This appeal has been preferred against the judgment dated\\n06.02.2013 passed by the Family Court, Secunderabad in\\nF.C.O.P.No.331 of 2009, preferred by the respondents No.1 to 3.\\n2. Before the learned Family Court, the appellants herein were\\narrayed as respondents No.2 and 3; respondents No.1 to 3 were the\\npetitioners and the respondent No.4/Railways Department was\\narrayed as the respondent No.1. The parties are hereinafter being\\nreferred to as they were arrayed in the OP filed before the learned\\nFamily Court.\\n3. The captioned OP was filed by the petitioners, for\\ndeclaration, declaring them as the legal heirs of late A.Ram Das,\\nwho was working in the respondent No.1/Railway Department till\\nhe expired on 12.10.2006. The petitioners had also prayed for\\nissuance of directions to the respondent No.1/Railway Department\\nto release his pensionary and other service benefits in their favour.\\nPetitioner No.1 described herself as the wife and the petitioners\\nNo.2 and 3 as the children of late A.Ram Das. The petitioners\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 1 of 12averred in the petition that the marriage of the petitioner No.1 had\\ntaken place with late A.Ram Das on 25.05.1972, at Yadagirigutta,\\nas per Hindu rituals and traditions. A.Ram Das was working in the\\nrespondent No.1/Railway Department on the post of a Senior\\nTechnician, Diesel Shed, Kazipet. He expired on 12.10.2006,\\nleaving behind the petitioners as his sole legal heirs. The petitioners\\nsubmitted a letter dated 29.11.2006 to the respondent No.1/Railway\\nDepartment along with supportive documents, for release of family\\npension and settlement of the dues of late A.Ram Das.\\nRespondents No.2 and 3 also lodged a claim with the respondent\\nNo.1/Railway Department on the family pension of the deceased on\\na plea that she was the wife of late A. Ram Das and the respondent\\nNo.3 was born from the wedlock and both of them were entitled to\\nfamily pension. Respondent No.1/Railway Department conducted\\nan enquiry whereafter they addressed a letter dated 28.09.2007 to\\nthe petitioner No.1 and the respondent No.2 intimating them that\\nthe marriage of the respondent No.2 with late A.Ram Das,\\nperformed on 08.08.1976, cannot be recognized and it was a\\nnullity, since the marriage of the petitioner No.1 with late A.Ram\\nDas, was performed earlier, on 25.05.1972, and it was still valid\\nand subsisting at the time of the demise of the employee. However\\nafter a month, the respondent No.1 addressed another letter dated\\n02.11.2007 to the petitioner No.1 and the respondent No.2\\ninforming them that after receiving a representation dated\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 2 of 1211.10.2017 from the respondent No.2, the Department had re-\\nexamined the matter and this time arrived at the conclusion that it\\nwas the respondent No.2 who was the legally wedded wife of late\\nA.Ram Das and not the petitioner No.1. As such, the pensionary\\nbenefits of late A.Ram Das would be payable to the respondent\\nNo.2.\\n4. Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision of the respondent\\nNo.1/Railway Department, the petitioners filed O.S.No.1037 of\\n2007, wherein it was averred that having held that the petitioners\\nwere the legal heirs of late A. Ram Das, during the first round of\\nscrutiny, there was no occasion for the respondent No.1/Railway\\nDepartment to have reopened the matter and resiled from the earlier\\nletter dated 02.11.2007, declaring them as the legal heirs of the\\ndeceased. The learned trial court declined to entertain the said suit\\nand directed the petitioners to approach the appropriate court for\\nrelief. The petitioners then filed F.C.O.P.No.331 of 2001 before the\\nlearned Judge, Family Court, Secunderabad praying inter alia that\\nthey be declared as the legal heirs of late A.Ram Das and sought\\nissuance of a direction to the respondent No.1/Railway Department\\nto release/pay the pensionary and other benefits exclusively to\\nthem. The respondents No.2 and 3 contested the claim of the\\npetitioners and filed a reply wherein they submitted that the\\npetitioner No.1 was employed as a teacher; she had retired from\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 3 of 12service and received her service benefits and is getting a monthly\\npension; that the petitioners No.2 and 3 are also married and settled\\nin their respective positions. It was averred that late A.Ram Das\\nhad contracted several debts and his lenders were pressing the\\nrespondent No.2 to return the amounts. Respondent No.2 further\\nstated that her name had been entered in the official records of the\\nrespondent No.1/Railway Department as the wife of the deceased\\nand that of respondent No.3, as his son and they are the only legal\\nheirs of late A.Ram Das. Respondents No.2 and 3 also denied the\\nmarriage of the petitioner No.1 with late A.Ram Das on 25.05.1972\\nand asserted that the marriage of the respondent No.2 with late\\nA.Ram Das had been performed on 08.03.1976 and the same was a\\nlawful marriage having been registered with the Marriage Registrar,\\nNanded. They were blessed with two sons. But, unfortunately, one\\nson had expired after the demise of A. Ram Das.\\n5. After the pleadings were complete, the following two issues\\nwere framed:-\\n“1. Whether the petitioners 1 to 3 are the legal heirs of\\nlate A. Ram Das who expired on 12.10.2006?\\n2. Whether petitioners are entitled to the pensionary\\nand educational and other service benefits of late\\nA. Ram Das?\\n3. To what relief?”\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 4 of 126. To prove their case, petitioner No.1 examined herself and\\nproduced three other witnesses. She stepped into the witness box\\nas P.W.1 and reiterated the averments made by her in the petition.\\nShe deposed that her marriage had taken place with Sri A.Ram Das\\non 25.05.1972 at Yadagirigutta, in the presence of relatives. She\\nproduced the marriage invitation card (Ex.A9), Marriage Certificate\\nissued by Laxmi Narasimha Swamy Devasthanam, Yadagirigutta\\n(Ex.A8) and the photographs taken during the wedding (Exs.A2\\nand A3). She stated that the petitioners No.2 and 3 were born from\\nthe said wedlock and their father, A. Ram Das had got them\\nadmitted in educational institutions. To prove that his name was\\nrecorded in the school certificates of the petitioners No.2 and 3,\\ntheir SSC Certificates were also filed (Exs.A6 and A7).\\n7. P.W.2, S.E. Susheela, deposed that she is a retired teacher\\nand had known the petitioner No.1 for the past forty years; that she\\nhad attended the marriage of the petitioner No.1 with A. Ram Das\\nand the said marriage had taken place in the presence of the elders\\nof both sides. P.W.3, Naga Narsamma, deposed that she knew the\\npetitioner No.1 from her childhood days and that she had attended\\nher marriage with A. Ram Das. She stated that after their marriage,\\npetitioner No.1 and her husband used to reside near her house and\\nfrequently visited her. P.W.4, T. Gouri Shanker, a Finger Print\\nExpert in the Fingerprint Bureau, Hyderabad, was produced by the\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 5 of 12petitioners to prove the thumb impression of the petitioner No.1\\naffixed at page No.98 of the Marriage Register maintained by the\\nTemple, by comparing the same with her thumb impression as was\\nobtained before the court. He proved his Report (Ex.X4) and stated\\nthat the disputed thumb impression was identical to the specimen\\nthumb impression of the petitioner No.1. Pertinently, the\\nrespondents elected not to cross examine P.W.4.\\n8. On their part, respondent No.2 entered the witness box as\\nR.W.1 and deposed that she was married to A.Ram Das on\\n08.03.1976 and that her marriage was recorded in the Register of\\nthe Marriages, Nanded; that she is the only legally wedded wife of\\nthe deceased; that the respondent No.3 is their son; that the name of\\nthe respondent No.2 was mentioned in the records of the respondent\\nNo.1/Railway Department as a legal heir of A. Ram Das; that upon\\nthe demise of A.Ram Das, it was she and her son who had\\nperformed his last rites and that the petitioners do not have any\\nclaim on his retrial benefits.\\n9. The respondents produced V.Komaraiah as R.W.2 who\\ndeposed that he was instrumental in getting the respondent No.1\\nand A.Ram Das to marry and the marriage was performed on\\n08.03.1976, at Nanded, Maharashtra as per Hindu rights and\\ncustoms; that it was an arranged marriage and the same was duly\\nregistered. The said marriage was consummated and the\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 6 of 12respondent No.2 and A.Ram Das were blessed with two sons, but\\none son had expired; that A.Ram Das was a bachelor at the time of\\nhis marriage and on his demise, his last rites were performed by the\\nrespondent No.2 and the respondent No.3. R.W.2 also deposed that\\nhe had never seen the petitioner No.1 earlier or even at the time of\\nthe demise of A.Ram Das. Ex.B4, a photocopy of the Marriage\\nCertificate issued by the Marriage Registrar, Nanded was filed by\\nthe respondents but no witness was summoned to prove the original\\nrecords.\\n10. After analysing the ocular and documentary evidence\\nproduced by the parties and on considering the arguments advanced\\nby learned counsel for the parties, the learned Family Court arrived\\nat the conclusion that overwhelming evidence had been filed by the\\npetitioners to demonstrate that the petitioner No.1 is the legally\\nwedded wife of A.Ram Das and that she has two children from the\\nsaid marriage, namely the petitioners No.2 and 3. The Family Court\\ndiscounted the confusion sought to be created by the respondents\\naround the name of the petitioner No.1, as recorded in the Marriage\\nRegister maintained by Laxmi Narasimha Swamy Devasthanam,\\nYadagirigutta, by referring to the other weighty evidence brought\\non record and concluded that the petitioner No.1 is the same person\\nwho was referred to as ‘Sarojini’ in the Marriage Register and the\\nwedding card. As a result, issue No.1 was answered in favour of\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 7 of 12the petitioners and they were declared to be the legal heirs of late\\nA. Ram Das.\\n11. As for the second issue, the learned Family Court held that\\nthere was a subsisting marriage between the petitioner No.1 and\\nA.Ram Das as on the date of the alleged marriage of the respondent\\nNo.2 with A. Ram Das that was solemnised on 08.03.1976.\\nReferring to the photocopy of the Marriage Certificate purportedly\\nissued by the Marriage Registrar, Nanded (Ex.B4) and filed by the\\nrespondents No.2 and 3, the impugned order records that the said\\nrespondents had failed to summon any witness with the records of\\nthe Registrar of Marriages, Nanded, to prove the Marriage\\nCertificate in respect of the respondent No.2 with A.Ram Das.\\nHolding that the petitioner No.1 had successfully proved that her\\nmarriage with A.Ram Das was solemnised on 25.05.1972, the\\nlearned Family Court held that the marriage of the respondent No.2\\nwith the same person cannot be treated as a legal and valid\\nmarriage. But, in view of the educational records filed by the\\nrespondents No.2 and 3 and the evidence brought on record, the\\nrespondent No.3 was also held to be the legitimate son of A.Ram\\nDas.\\n12. The second issue was accordingly answered by the Family\\nCourt by holding that besides the petitioners No.1, 2 and 3, the\\nrespondent No.3 (the son born from the alliance of the respondent\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 8 of 12No.2 with A.Ram Das) is also his legal heir, being his legitimate\\nchild and therefore, he would be entitled to the pensionary and\\nother service benefits of late A.Ram Das at par with the petitioners\\nNo.2 and 3 who were born from the wedlock of the petitioner No.1\\nand A. Ram Das. Resultantly, petitioners No.1, 2 and 3 and the\\nrespondent No.3 were declared as the legal heirs of late A.Ram\\nDas.\\n13. The aforesaid judgment has been assailed by Mr. Gouri\\nShankar Sanghi, learned counsel appearing for the respondents\\nNo.2 and 3 on the ground that the learned Family Court has erred in\\ngiving precedence to the Marriage Certificate issued by the\\nYadagirigutta Temple, over the Marriage Certificate issued by a\\nstatutory body, namely the Registrar of Marriages; that the learned\\nFamily Court failed to appreciate the fact that the name of the\\nrespondents No.2 and 3 had been duly recorded in the service\\nrecords of the deceased, as his nominees and therefore, they ought\\nto have been declared as his sole legal heirs and entitled to all his\\npensionary benefits and lastly, that the respondents No.2 and 3 had\\nbeen residing with A.Ram Das in the Railway Quarters allotted to\\nhim during his lifetime, which fact was ignored by the Family\\nCourt.\\n14. We have carefully perused the records and given our\\nthoughtful consideration to the submissions made by Mr. Yadaiah,\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 9 of 12learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Gouri Shankar Sanghi,\\nlearned counsel for the respondents.\\n15. In the light of the oral and documentary evidence produced\\nby the petitioners and the respondent No.2, as has been discussed\\nabove, the respondents No.2 and 3 have undoubtedly failed to rebut\\nthe presumption that the petitioner No.1 is the legally wedded wife\\nof late A.Ram Das and the petitioners No.2 and 3 were born from\\nthe said wedlock. It has to be seen that the original of Ex.B4, copy\\nof the marriage certificate, filed by the respondents No.2 and 3 was\\nneither filed in the Court, nor was the concerned officer from the\\noffice of the Registrar of Marriages, Nanded, summoned with the\\nrecords to prove the said document, as per law. The evidence of\\nR.W.3 and R.W.4 also discloses that R.W.1 had got married to late\\nA.Ram Das on 08.03.1976. Given the said position, the learned\\nFamily Court has rightly held that the petitioner No.1 is the legally\\nwedded wife of late A.Ram Das, their marriage having been\\nperformed on 25.05.1972, at a much earlier point in time than the\\nmarriage of the respondent No.2 with late A.Ram Das that was\\nsolemnised after almost four years, on 08.03.1976. That being the\\nsequence of events, the marriage of the respondent No.2 with late\\nA.Ram Das, even though registered, cannot be held to be a legal\\nand valid marriage as the marriage between the petitioner No.1 and\\nlate A.Ram Das was subsisting as on 08.03.1976 and no evidence\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 10 of 12has been brought on record to demonstrate that A. Ram Das and the\\npetitioner No.1 had got divorced before he had contracted a second\\nmarriage with the respondent No.2. Since the marriage of the\\nrespondent No.2 is not a valid marriage, she cannot stake a claim\\non the pensionary benefits as the legal heir of late A.Ram Das as\\nhis lawfully wedded wife. We therefore accept the findings of the\\nlearned Family Court that the petitioner No.1 was the legally\\nwedded wife of A. Ram Das and the respondent No.1 cannot claim\\nthe said status.\\n16. At the same time, the Family Court has gone on to observe\\nthat the respondent No.3, who was born from the wedlock of the\\nrespondent No.2 and late A.Ram Das, being his legitimate son,\\nwould also be entitled to a share in the estate of the deceased. The\\nsaid finding has been predicated on Section 16 of the Hindu\\nMarriage Act that bestows legitimacy on children, not withstanding\\nthe fact that the marriage between their parents is void. As per the\\nsettled legal proposition, a child born from an invalid or void\\nmarriage is entitled to get a share from the personal estate of his/her\\ndeceased father. In Rameshwari Devi v. State of Bihar reported as\\n(2000) 2 SCC 431, the Supreme Court has held that even if a\\nGovernment servant has contracted a second marriage during the\\nsubsistence of his first marriage, the children born out of such a\\nsecond marriage would still be legitimate, though the second\\nF.C.A.No.127 of 2015 Page 11 of 12marriage itself would be void. The said decision has been endorsed\\nby the Supreme Court in Vidhyadhari and others v. Sukhrana Bai\\nand others reported as (2008) 2 SCC 238. (Also refer:- Jinia\\nKeotin v. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi, reported as (2003) 1 SCC 730\\nand Neelamma v. Sarojamma, reported as (2006) 9 SCC 612).\\n17. In the light of the above discussion, this court does not find\\nany patent error, illegality or perversity in the impugned order that\\ndeserves interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed along\\nwith the pending applications, if any, while leaving the parties to\\nbear their own costs.\\n_________________\\nHIMA KOHLI, CJ\\n______________________\\nB.

RAJASHEKER REDDY\\nARBITRATION APPLICATION Nos. 56 and 61 of 2018\\nCOMMON ORDER:\\nThe issue in these applications is one and same therefore they\\nare being heard and disposed of by a common order.\\n2. These applications are filed under Section 11(6) of the\\nArbitration Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter, the Act) praying to\\nappoint an arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes and differences\\nbetween the applicant and the respondents in respect of Supply\\nOrder (for short, SO) dated 22-11-2012 and dt. 05-01-2013\\nrespectively. These applications have raised an interesting question\\nas to where shall be the seat of the arbitration when the agreements\\nbetween the parties provide for the ‘venue’ instead of ‘seat’ in\\ncases of disputes at ordnance factory, Chanda, Chandrapur in\\nMaharashtra.\\n3. The brief facts which led to the filing of these arbitration\\napplications are as under;\\nThe applicant in arbitration application 56 of 2018, entered\\ninto an agreement with respondent no.1 for the supply of 42,924\\nno. units of Fuze Percn after procuring the tender dated 19-02-\\n2011 that was floated by respondent no 1 vide DA No. 162 MK-8(M-2). Subsequently the applicant received supply order being SO\\nNo.1121132/A1 dated 22-11-2012.\\nSimilarly in arbitration application 61 of 2018 the applicant\\nentered into an agreement with respondent no. 1 for supply of\\n49,056 units of Fuze Percn after procuring the tender that was\\nfloated by the respondent no 1 through notice dated 15-07-2011.\\nSubsequently, the supply order vide no 1121150/A1 dated\\n05.01.2013 was issued to the applicant.\\nSince the respondents in the counter affidavit have raised the\\nissue of lack of territorial jurisdiction of this Court, it is relevant to\\nextract para-27 of the counter affidavit in A.A.No.56 of 2018 filed\\non behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2 therein, which reads as under :\\n“27. In reply to Para No.21 to 24, the contentions of Applicants\\nare false, baseless and untenable. As per the clause, this Hon’ble\\nCourt lacks territorial jurisdiction. Moreover as admitted by the\\napplicant as an award was passed on 05.06.2017 itself, therefore,\\nthe present application is not maintainable. It is submitted that, as\\nper term and condition No.13 of Annexure OFCH-634 of Tender\\nDocuments “All questions, disputes or differences arising under,\\nout of or in connection with the contract, if concluded shall be\\nsubject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court within the location\\nlimits of whose jurisdiction, the place from which the Acceptanceof Tender is issued is situated.” Further, as per clause No.20(3) of\\nDGS&D-68 (Revised) (excluding Clause Nol24) – The Courts of\\nthe place from where the acceptance of tender has been issued\\nshall alone have jurisdiction to decide any dispute arising out of or\\nin respect of the contract. Hence the matter of jurisdiction is not\\ncorresponding/relates to the place of manufacturing of the Item.”\\n4. It is also stated that respondent No.3 passed Award and they\\nhave challenged the said Award before the appropriate Forum. The\\nother contentions in the counter affidavit deal with the merits of\\nthe claim.\\n5. Clause 14 of the SO dated 22-11-2012 and clause 14 of the\\nSO dated 05-01-2013 relate to arbitration. Clause 14 in arbitration\\napplication 61 of 2018 is the verbatim of Clause 14 of arbitration\\napplication 56 of 2018, therefore for the sake of convenience only\\nclause 14 from arbitration application 56 of 2018 is being\\nreproduced, as the clause assumes relevance for the controversy\\nraised and therefore being reproduced for the ready reference;\\n14. Arbitration: All disputes and differences arising out of or in\\naccordance with the present contract including the one connected\\nwith the validity of the present contract or any part thereof should be\\nsettled by bilateral discussion.\\nAny disputes, disagreements of question arising out of or relating to\\nthis contract or relating to construction or performance (except as to\\nany matter or decision or determination whereof is provided for by\\nthese condition), which can not be settled amicably, to be referred by\\nconcerned party to Director general, Ordnance Factories, Govt of\\nIndia, ordnance Factories Board, 10ASK Bose Road, Kolkata 700001\\nfor appointment of the sole arbitrator. The Arbitrator so appointed\\nshall be a Government servant who has not dealt with matters towhich this agreement relates and in course of his duties had not\\nexpressed views on all or any of the matter in dispute or differences.\\nThe Award of Sole Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the\\nparties.\\nThe venue of the Arbitration shall be at place of concerned factory.\\nFurther the Arbitration proceedings would be subject to the provision of the\\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the rules there under.\\n6. What the clauses of SO lay is the venue and the not seat of\\narbitration.\\n7. Learned counsel for the applicant has contended that a part of\\nthe cause of action arose within the territorial limits of this court;\\nthe applicant carries on business here in Hyderabad and goods\\nhave been supplied to Mahrashtra from Hyderabad. Therefore\\nterritorial jurisdiction of this court has been claimed. The goods,\\nwhich are subject matter of dispute between the applicant and the\\nrespondent, were manufactured in Hyderabad and that all the\\ncorrespondence between the applicant and respondent No.1 held at\\nHyderabad, therefore, this Court has territorial jurisdiction to\\nentertain the application. She also submits that respondent No.3\\nshould not have been appointed as an Arbitrator, since respondent\\nNos.1 and 3 are under the supervision and control of respondent\\nNo.2 and the same is hit by Section 12 of the Act r/w. Schedule V\\n(2) and VII (2) of the Act, as such the Award passed by respondent\\nNo.2 on 05.06.2016 is void ab initio and the Award is non-est in\\nlaw.Learned counsel for the applicant has placed reliance upon\\nthe judgement of the Supreme Court in TRF LIMTED vs.\\n1\\nENERGO ENGINEERING PROJECTS LIMITED ..\\n8. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents has\\nvehemently opposed the contention made by the petitioner. As per\\nthe averments made in the counter affidavits, it has been argued,\\non behalf of the respondents, that the clauses 14 of the supply\\norders in these two arbitration applications specifically provide that\\nthe venue for arbitration shall be at place of factory concerned, as\\nsuch this Court does not have territorial jurisdiction. It is the\\nargument of the respondent that in the absence of the term seat in\\nthe arbitration clause, venue should be read as seat and therefore\\nthe applications are liable to be dismissed as this Court does not\\nhave territorial jurisdiction. It is also submitted that respondent\\nNo.3 has already passed Award, as such, the applicant has to\\nchallenge the said Award in an appropriate application before the\\nappropriate Forum and not in the present application.\\n9. In view of rival contentions regarding the territorial\\njurisdiction to entertain these applications, the issue that arises for\\nconsideration is;\\n(1) Whether this Court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain\\nthese applications? &\\n1 (2017) 8 SCC 377(2) Whether in absence of conferment of juridical seat, would\\nthe venue amount to seat so designated by the parties in\\nthe agreement?\\nIssue Nos.1 and 2 :\\n10. This is perhaps a cliché; nevertheless, parties in arbitration\\nare free to choose the forum to settle their dispute by appointing\\nthe arbitrator. Section 20, sub section (1) of the Act of 1996,\\nprovides that the parties are free to agree on the place of\\narbitration. The seat of arbitration is a crucial factor. It determines\\nthe lex arbitri and the courts with supervisory jurisdiction over the\\narbitration.\\n11. The important consequences of the seat require parties to\\nchoose the seat carefully. Cases where no seat but venue is chosen\\nby the parties are not uncommon. The reliance has been placed by\\nthe learned counsel for the applicant on TRF LIMTED (Supra).\\nBut a perusal of the judgment would reveal that the controversy\\nbefore the Supreme Court in the above said judgment was never\\nabout seat or venue of arbitration. The said judgment was cited by\\nlearned counsel for the petitioners for disqualifying an Arbitrator\\nand since this Court has come to the conclusion that it does not\\nhave territorial jurisdiction to entertain the applications, the said\\naspect need not be considered.12. Recently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court addressed an\\ninteresting aspect pertaining to the issue, does the selection of a\\n‘venue’ for arbitration imply choice of the ‘seat’? In Brahmani\\n2\\nRiver Pellets Limited v. Kamachi Industries Limited the apex\\ncourt has addressed this issue. Against the order of Madras High\\nCourt, a SLP was filed before the Apex Court. The Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court first took the cognizance of the arbitration clause,\\nwhich is similar to in the instant case, which is being reproduced\\nhere for ready reference;\\n4. Clause 18 of the agreement between the parties contains an\\narbitration clause which reads as under:—\\n“18. Arbitration shall be under Indian Arbitration and Conciliation\\nLaw 1996 and the Venue of Arbitration shall be Bhubaneswar.”\\nThe question that the Apex Court posed to itself was; Whether the\\nMadras High Court could exercise jurisdiction under Section 11(6)\\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 despite the fact that\\nthe agreement contains the clause that venue of arbitration shall be\\nat Bhubaneswar. The Apex Court having considered several\\njudgments delivered by it held;\\n“18. Where the contract specifies the jurisdiction of the court at a\\nparticular place, only such court will have the jurisdiction to deal with\\nthe matter and parties intended to exclude all other courts. In the present\\ncase, the parties have agreed that the “venue” of arbitration shall be at\\nBhubaneswar. Considering the agreement of the parties having\\nBhubaneswar as the venue of arbitration, the intention of the parties is to\\nexclude all other courts. As held in Swastik, non-use of words like\\n2 2019 SCC Online SC 929“exclusive jurisdiction”, “only”, “exclusive”, “alone” is not decisive\\nand does not make any material difference.\\n19. When the parties have agreed to the have the “venue” of\\narbitration at Bhubaneshwar, the Madras High Court erred in assuming\\nthe jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Act. Since only the Orissa\\nHigh Court will have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed under\\nSection 11(6) of the Act, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.”\\n13. The judgment in Brahmani River has also found support in\\nthe recent judgment delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the\\n3\\nmatter of BGS SGS SOMA JV vs. NHPC LTD. Speaking for the\\nbench, His Lordship Justice Rohinton Nariman, J. held that;\\n84. Most recently, in Brahmani River Pellets (supra), this Court in a\\ndomestic arbitration considered clause 18 - which was the arbitration\\nagreement between the parties - and which stated that arbitration shall be\\nunder Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the venue of\\narbitration shall be Bhubaneswar. After citing several judgments of this\\nCourt and then referring to Indus Mobile Distribution (supra), wherein\\nthis Court held that:\\n19. A conspectus of all the aforesaid provisions shows that the moment\\nthe seat is designated, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. On\\nthe facts of the present case, it is clear that the seat of arbitration is\\nMumbai and Clause 19 further makes it clear that jurisdiction exclusively\\nvests in the Mumbai courts. Under the Law of Arbitration, unlike the\\nCode of Civil Procedure which applies to suits filed in courts, a reference\\nto “seat” is a concept by which a neutral venue can be chosen by the\\nparties to an arbitration clause. The neutral venue may not in the\\nclassical sense have jurisdiction — that is, no part of the cause of action\\nmay have arisen at the neutral venue and neither would any of the\\nprovisions of Sections 16 to 21 of CPC be attracted. In arbitration law\\nhowever, as has been held above, the moment “seat” is determined, the\\nfact that the seat is at Mumbai would vest Mumbai courts with exclusive\\njurisdiction for purposes of regulating arbitral proceedings arising out of\\nthe agreement between the parties.\\n20. It is well settled that where more than one court has jurisdiction, it is\\nopen for the parties to exclude all other courts. For an exhaustive\\nanalysis of the case law, see Swastik Gases (P) Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn.\\nLtd. [Swastik Gases (P) Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd., (2013) 9 SCC 32 :\\n(2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 157] This was followed in a recent judgment in B.E.\\nSimoese Von Staraburg Niedenthal v. Chhattisgarh Investment Ltd. [B.E.\\nSimoese Von Staraburg Niedenthal v. Chhattisgarh Investment Ltd.,\\n3 2019 SCC Online SCC 1585(2015) 12 SCC 225 : (2016) 1 SCC (Civ) 427] Having regard to the\\nabove, it is clear that Mumbai courts alone have jurisdiction to the\\nexclusion of all other courts in the country, as the juridical seat of\\narbitration is at Mumbai. This being the case, the impugned judgment\\n[Datawind Innovations (P) Ltd. v. Indus Mobile Distribution (P) Ltd.,\\n2016 SCC OnLine Del 3744] is set aside. The injunction confirmed by\\nthe impugned judgment will continue for a period of four weeks from the\\ndate of pronouncement of this judgment, so that the respondents may take\\nnecessary steps under Section 9 in the Mumbai Court. The appeals are\\ndisposed of accordingly.\\n85. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it may be concluded that\\nwhenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an\\narbitration clause as being the “venue” of the arbitration proceedings, the\\nexpression “arbitration proceedings” would make it clear that the “venue”\\nis really the “seat” of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression\\ndoes not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the\\narbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at\\nthat place. This language has to be contrasted with language such as\\n“tribunals are to meet or have witnesses, experts or the parties” where\\nonly hearings are to take place in the “venue”, which may lead to the\\nconclusion, other things being equal, that the venue so stated is not the\\n“seat” of arbitral proceedings, but only a convenient place of meeting.\\nFurther, the fact that the arbitral proceedings “shall be held” at a\\nparticular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor\\narbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that the\\nplace is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there\\nbeing no other significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely\\na “venue” and not the “seat” of the arbitral proceedings, would then\\nconclusively show that such a clause designates a “seat” of the arbitral\\nproceedings. In an International context, if a supranational body of rules\\nis to govern the arbitration, this would further be an indicia that “the\\nvenue”, so stated, would be the seat of the arbitral proceedings. In a\\nnational context, this would be replaced by the Arbitration Act, 1996 as\\napplying to the “stated venue”, which then becomes the “seat” for the\\npurposes of arbitration.\\n14. Where the contract specifically confers the jurisdiction on a\\nparticular Court at a particular place, only such court will have the\\njurisdiction to deal with the matter as parties intended to exclude\\nall other courts. In the present applications, the parties have agreed\\nthat the “venue” of arbitration shall be at place of concernedfactory i.e., ordnance factory, Chanda, Chandrapur in Maharashtra.\\nConsidering the agreement of the parties having ordnance factory,\\nin Maharashtra as the venue of arbitration, the intention of the\\nparties is to exclude all other courts. As held in Swastik, non-use of\\nwords like “exclusive jurisdiction”, “only”, “exclusive”, “alone” is\\nnot decisive and does not make any material difference, the\\ncontention of the applicant that this Court also has the jurisdiction\\nis merit-less and therefore deserves to be rejected in view of the\\nlaw laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.\\n15. Thus this Court cannot assume territorial jurisdiction for\\nentertaining these applications under Section 11(6) of the Act and,\\ntherefore, these applications deserve to be dismissed. Since this\\nCourt dealt with the territorial jurisdiction and came to the\\nconclusion that it does not have territorial jurisdiction, other issues\\nraised and the judgements cited on those issues are not required to\\nbe considered.\\nIn view of the facts and circumstances and the law laid down\\nby the Hon’ble Apex Court in the judgments cited supra, this Court\\nlacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application under\\nSection 11(6) of the Act and hence the same is liable to be\\ndismissed and it is accordingly dismissed. However, the parties are\\nat liberty to approach the High Court concerned having territorialjurisdiction seeking appointment of an Arbitrator. There shall be\\nno order as to costs. Miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending shall\\nstand closed.\\n______________________\\nA. RAJASHEKER REDDY, J\\nDate: 29.04.2020.\\nNOTE: L.R. Copy be marked.\\n(B/O)\\nMsr',\n",

We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf\\nof the parties with consent and perused the material on the record;\\nand hereby proceed to decide the Writ Appeal No. 90 of 2023 itself,\\nby way of the following order.\\n2. The present writ appeal assails the order dated\\n18.09.2018 rendered by the learned Single Judge of this Court\\nallowing the Writ Petition (C) No. 282 of 2017 instituted on behalf of\\nDr. Mayanglambam Devachandra Singh, whereby the State of\\nManipur was directed to absorb him as Assistant Professor in the\\ndepartment of Environment Science vide order dated 31.08.2016\\nand joined on 01.09.2016.\\n3. Aggrieved by the said impugned order dated\\n18.09.2018, the State of Manipur instituted the present writ appeal,\\nalbeit belatedly. This Court dismissed the said application instituted\\non behalf of the State of Manipur seeking condonation of delay in\\nfiling the accompanying appeal, vide final judgment and order dated\\n22.07.2020 in MC(WA) No. 46 of 2020.\\n4.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court set aside the said order\\ndated 22.07.2020 vide its order dated 18th April, 2023; allowing the\\nsaid Special Leave Petition No. 13554 of 2020 by observing and\\nfurther directing as follows :-\\n“The writ petitioner approached the High\\nCourt seeking his absorption and this was allowed\\nby the learned Single Judge. The reason as to why\\nthe appeal of the State failed before the Division\\nBench of the High Court has already been\\nindicated by us earlier in this order. We found,\\nhowever, from the judgment of the First Court that\\nthe issue of the writ petitioner fulfilling the eligibility\\ncriteria was not addressed to. On behalf of the\\nState, it is argued that it was not their fault as it\\nwas the Managing Committee which did not send\\nthe name of the writ petitioner for absorption.\\nIn these circumstances, we are of the view\\nthat the Division Bench of the High Court ought to\\nhave examined as to whether the writ petitioner\\nhad fulfilled the eligibility criteria for the post in\\nwhich he was directed to be absorbed. Rejection\\nof the State’s appeal solely on the ground of delay\\nwas not warranted in the facts of this case.\\nWe, accordingly, set aside the impugned\\njudgment and direct the High Court to examine the\\nappeal filed by the State on the question as to\\nwhether the writ petitioner fulfilled the eligibility\\ncriteria for being appointed in an aided college in\\nthe post he was inducted in and as to whether he\\nWA No. 90 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 282 of 2017)P age | 4\\nwas eligible for absorption as a government\\nemployee, at par with other similarly situated\\ncandidates who were absorbed.\\nWe also make it clear that in the event the\\nState relies only 3 on the point that because his\\nname was not sent by the concerned managing\\ncommittee they could not absorb him, that stand\\nwould not be a tenable one as this aspect has\\nalready been addressed to by the First Court and\\nwe do not find any flaw in the reasoning of the First\\nCourt on that point.\\nIn the event there is any maximum age limit\\nfor appointment to the post in question, then the\\ndate of the writ petitioner joining the aided college\\nin the post in question shall be the relevant date\\nfor consideration.\\nThe appeal stands disposed of in the above\\nterms.\\nPending application(s), if any, shall stand\\ndisposed of.\\nThere shall be no order as to costs.”\\n6. A plain reading of the observations rendered by the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court leave no manner of doubt that whilst setting\\naside the order passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court, by\\ncondoning the delay in filing the present writ appeal, the Supreme\\nCourt further directed that the Division Bench ought to examine the\\nWA No. 90 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 282 of 2017)P age | 5\\nsaid appeal from the standpoint of the issue, as to whether the writ\\npetitioner fulfills the eligibility criteria for being appointed in the\\naided college in the post which he was inducted in and as to\\nwhether he was eligible for absorption as government employee, at\\npar with other similarly situated candidates who were so absorbed.\\nThe Hon’ble Supreme Court vide the said order dated 18th April,\\n2023 further clarified that the argument of the State that the original\\nwrit petitioner was not absorbed because his name was not sent by\\nthe concerned managing committee, is untenable and would not be\\navailable to them in view of the unimpeachable findings arrived at\\nby the learned Single Judge in this behalf, whilst disposing of the\\nwrit petition.\\n7. Our attention has been invited to the relevant original\\nrecord in relation to the writ petitioner; which includes the\\nproceedings of the meeting of the “Verification Committee”\\nconvened on the 18th March, 2021, for verification of service records\\nof two left out teachers of Jiri College, Jiribam; which evidently\\nincludes him at Sl. No. 1. A perusal of the said minutes clearly and\\nunequivocally reflects that the “verification committee”, upon\\nconsideration of the documents related to the writ petitioner’s\\neducational qualifications, found him qualified for the post of\\nAssistant Professor in the relevant subject college as per the 2010\\nRecruitment Rules.\\nWA No. 90 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 282 of 2017)P age | 6\\n8. In view of the foregoing, the substantial issue framed\\nfor the consideration of this Court by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,\\nas elaborated hereinabove, stands answered in favour of the writ\\npetitioner and against the writ appellant.\\n9. In other words, the writ petitioner, it is an admitted\\nposition, was qualified, as per the 2010 Recruitment Rules, from the\\ninitial date of his appointment to hold the subject post. Resultantly,\\nthe writ petitioner is axiomatically entitled to the benefit of\\nabsorption in the subject institution consequent upon the writ\\nappellant taking the policy decision dated the 18th December, 2016,\\nto take over the said aided college and absorb all the staffs\\nemployed therein.\\n10. Resultantly, the writ appeal fails and is accordingly\\ndismissed.\\n11. The State of Manipur is hereby directed to absorb the\\nwrit petitioner in the post of Assistant Professor in the department\\nof Environment Science with effect from 1st September, 2016,\\nforthwith.\\nJUDGE CHIEF JUSTICE\\nFR/NFR\\nSushil\\nWA No. 90 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 282 of 2017)',\n",

(C) No. 584 of 2018 Page 1[2] The case of the petitioners is that they were all Trained\\nGraduate Teachers in the Education (S) Department, Government of\\nManipur, enjoying senior scale of pay of Rs. 9300-34800 plus AGP of Rs.\\n4500/- as per the revision of scale of pay, vide order dated 03.06.2011 (at\\nAnnexure A/25 of the writ petition) before they retired from their service on\\nattaining the age of superannuation w.e.f following dates:-\\n(i) Petitioner No. 1, Kh.

Tomcha Meetei, learned Advocate appearing for\\nthe petitioner and Smt. L. Monomala, learned Government Advocate\\nappearing for the respondents.\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[2]\\n[2] The validity and correctness of the order of detention dated\\n29-01-2020 passed by the District Magistrate, Thoubal District, Manipur is\\nunder challenge in this writ petition.\\n[3.1] The allegations as stated in the grounds of detention dated 29-\\n01-2020 are, short, that the detenu is an international drug smuggler and\\nhas network of transportation of WY Tablets from across Myanmar into\\nIndia. The modus operandi of the detenu was the smuggling of WY Tablets\\nrolled into carpets and then, transported to Silchar and Dimapur via Moreh\\nand Imphal. In the statements given by all the accomplices, the name of the\\ndetenu has figured as the Kingpin. It came to light when a seizure of drug\\nconsignment worth Rs.400 crore was made by the Thoubal Police on 24-\\n08-2019 which were rolled into carpets and loaded into a DI Truck driven by\\nMd. Hussain who revealed that he was getting the consignment into India\\nupon his instructions. The detenu was arrested based on the information\\ngiven by the driver of the truck. The total value of drug seizure was\\nestimated to be around Rs.400 crore for which a case under FIR No.\\n94(8)2019 TBL-PS u/s 22(C)/29/60(3) ND & PS Act dated 24-08-2019 was\\nregistered by the police. Thereafter, the entire network of drug smuggling\\nwas busted at Thoubal and Agartala. The detenu revealed his nexus in the\\nsmuggling of WY Tablets into India and confessed that he used to transport\\nWY Tablets from Myanmar to Manipur and then, to Bangladesh. On 28-01-\\n2020, the detenu was granted bail by the Special Judge, ND & PS, Thoubal\\nDistrict, Manipur.\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[3]\\n[3.2] While in police custody, the order of detention was passed by the\\nDistrict Magistrate, Thoubal District. The driving consideration for his\\ndetention, is that the detenu is a foreign national and there is a high chance\\nthat he may abscond and travel beyond the jurisdictional reach of the police\\nand he may continue such activities. The scale of his activities is very large.\\nThe consignment caught was one of the several consignments which were\\ndelivered by him which indicate his links to narco terrorism. Such a large\\npresence of drugs is prejudicial to the security of the State and public order.\\nThe drug money is often used to fund insurgent groups and violent\\nactivities across the country, especially in Manipur and other parts of North\\nEast India. In view of the scale and scope of drug smuggling, it is a threat to\\nthe public order.\\n[3.3] The detenu is a dangerous man with dogged determination with\\ncool calculation and malevolent design to disrupt the public order affecting\\npublic tranquillity. The detenu is a dangerous and renowned drug smuggler.\\nIn view of his prejudicial activities in the immediate past, it is likely that he\\nmay continue to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public\\norder. Normal criminal laws are not sufficient to prevent him from his\\ncommission of prejudicial activities. After the order of detention being\\npassed, he was informed that he has the right to make representations to\\nthe Government of Manipur as well as the Central Government against it\\nwhich can be sent through the Superintendent of Police.\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[4]\\n[4] Being aggrieved by the order of detention, the instant writ petition\\nhas been filed by the petitioner questioning it on inter-alia various grounds\\nthat when he was arrested at the Airport, no contraband article was seized\\nfrom his possession; that there is no reasonable ground made in the\\ninvestigation that he has committed the offence as alleged against him; that\\nthere is no any evidence to connect him with the WY tablets seized from\\nthe driver, except the statement given by the driver; that no case has been\\nmade out against him to justify the detention under the provisions of the\\nNational Security Act, 1980 and that the detention order was issued on 29-\\n01-2020 after his being released on bail by the Special Judge, ND & PS,\\nThoubal District, Manipur on 28-01-2020. During the course of hearing, one\\nissue as to whether there was any material before the District Magistrate for\\nher satisfaction that the detenu was likely to be released on bail, did\\nemerge, as the detenu was detained while in custody. But since this point\\nwas not raised in the writ petition, Shri P. Tomcha, learned counsel was\\ngranted some time to seek instructions in the matter. When the matter was\\ntaken up for consideration on 30-11-2020, he submitted that the writ\\npetition being a habeas corpus petition, this point could be considered by\\nthis Court in terms of the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court\\nin Mohinuddin Vs. District Magistrate, (1987) 4 SCC 58 where the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court held that it was an improper exercise of power on\\nthe part of the High Court disallowing the writ petition on the ground of\\nimperfect pleadings. Normally, writ petitions are decided on the basis of\\naffidavits and the petitioner cannot be permitted to raise grounds not taken\\nin the petition at the hearing. The same rule cannot be applied to a petition\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[5]\\nfor grant of a writ of habeas corpus. It is enough for the detenu to say that\\nhe is under wrongful detention and the burden lies on the detaining\\nauthority to satisfy the Court that the detention is not illegal or wrongful and\\nthat the detenu is not entitled to the relief claimed.\\n[5] The District Magistrate, respondent No.1, in her affidavit, has\\nstated that the detenu is an international drug smuggler and has a network\\nof transportation of WY tablets from across Myanmar into India. His modus\\noperandi was smuggling of WY tablets rolled into carpets and then,\\ntransported to Silchar and Dimapur via Moreh and Imphal. He was arrested\\nby a police team of Thoubal District in connect with the case registered\\nunder FIR No.94 (8) 2019 TBL-PS. He is not a citizen of India. An affidavit\\non behalf of the respondent Nos.2 to 4 has been filed reiterating what has\\nbeen stated in the grounds of detention and in addition thereto, it has been\\nstated that the State Government approved the order of detention on 07-\\n02-2020 after considering the grounds of detention and other relevant\\ndocuments furnished by the District Magistrate with due application of\\njudicious mind and the same was reported to the Central Government as\\nwell as the Advisory Board. The detention of the detenu was confirmed by\\nthe State Government on 25-02-2020. In the affidavit filed by the\\nrespondent No.5, it has been stated that the detenu was granted bail by the\\nSpecial Judge, ND & PS, Thoubal on 28-01-2020, which was received by\\nhim in the evening and on that itself, the detenu has been released from the\\njail. It has been denied by him that instead of releasing the detenu, the jail\\nauthority did hand over the detenu to the police. It has further been stated\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[6]\\nthat the representations addressed to the District Magistrate, Thoubal and\\nthe Chief Secretary, Manipur were received on 22-02-2020 and the same\\nwere forwarded to the concerned authorities on the same day.\\n[6] In exercise of power conferred under the provisions of the\\nNational Security Act, 1980, the order of detention was passed by the\\nDistrict Magistrate, Thoubal/ detaining authority on the basis of her\\nsubjective satisfaction. It is well settled that the Court cannot go into the\\ncorrectness of the decision of the detaining authority but can look into the\\ndecision-making process. In other words, the Court can scrutinize the\\nmaterials relied upon by the detaining authority in coming to his/her\\nconclusion. While examining the correctness of the decision-making\\nprocess, two issues are required to be considered by the Court- one,\\nwhether there are materials on which reliance was placed by the detaining\\nauthority in passing the detention order and two, the detaining authority\\nwas justified in arriving at a finding based on the said materials that the\\ndetenu be detained without any trial. Since a person can be detained on\\nsuspicion, the procedural safeguards are to be strictly observed in order to\\nprevent misuse of the law of preventive detention. It is also well settled\\nthat a person who is in custody, can also be detained under the\\nprovisions of the National Security Act, 1980 after having followed the\\nprinciples laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Union of India Vs.\\nPaul Manickam, (2003) 8 SCC 342 and the principles which have been\\nlaid down therein are found in para 14 which is reproduced herein below:-\\n“14. So far as this question relating to the procedure to be adopted\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[7]\\nin case the detenu is already in custody is concerned, the\\nmatter has been dealt with in several cases. Where detention\\norders are passed in relation to persons who are already in jail\\nunder some other laws, the detaining authorities should apply\\ntheir mind and show their awareness in this regard in the\\ngrounds of detention, the chances of release of such persons\\non bail. The necessity of keeping such persons in detention\\nunder the preventive detention laws has to be clearly\\nindicated. Subsisting custody of the detenu by itself does not\\ninvalidate an order of his preventive detention, and the\\ndecision in this regard must depend on the facts of the\\nparticular case. Preventive detention being necessary to\\nprevent the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the\\nsecurity of the State or to the maintenance of public order or\\neconomic stability etc. ordinarily, it is not needed when the\\ndetenu is already in custody. The detaining authority must\\nshow its awareness to the fact of subsisting custody of the\\ndetenu and take that factor into account while making the\\norder. If the detaining authority is reasonably satisfied with\\ncogent materials that there is likelihood of his release and in\\nview of his antecedent activities which are proximate in point\\nof time, he must be detained in order to prevent him from\\nindulging in such prejudicial activities, the detention order can\\nbe validly made. Where the detention order in respect of a\\nperson already in custody does not indicate that the detenu\\nwas likely to be released on bail, the order would be vitiated.\\n(See N. Meera Rani v. Govt. of T.N. and Dharmendra\\nSuganchand Chelawat v. Union of India.) The point was gone\\ninto detail in Kamarunnissa v. Union of India. The principles\\nwere set out as follows: even in the case of a person in\\ncustody, a detention order can be validly passed: (1) if the\\nauthority passing the order is aware of the fact that he is\\nactually in custody; (2) if he has a reason to believe on the\\nbasis of reliable material placed before him (a) that there is a\\nreal possibility of his release on bail, and (b) that on being\\nreleased, he would in all probability indulge in prejudicial\\nactivities; and (3) if it is felt essential to detain him to prevent\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[8]\\nhim from so doing. If an order is passed after recording\\nsatisfaction in that regard, the order would be valid. In the\\ncase at hand the order of detention and grounds of detention\\nshow an awareness of custody and/or a possibility of release\\non bail.”\\nThe aforesaid principles were followed in Rekha Vs. State of\\nTamil Nadu & Ors., (2011) 4 SCC 260, in which the Hon’ble Supreme\\nCourt held that,\\n“26. It was held in Union of India V. Paula Manickam that if the\\ndetaining authority is aware of the fact that the detenu is in\\ncustody and the detaining authority is reasonably satisfied with\\ncogent material that there is likelihood of his release and in\\nview of his antecedent activities he must be detained to\\nprevent him from indulging in such prejudicial activities, the\\ndetention order can validly be made.\\n27. In our opinion, there is a real possibility of release of a person on\\nbail who is already in custody provided he has moved a bail\\napplication which is pendig. It follows logically that if no bail\\napplication is pending, then there is no likelihood of the person\\nin custody being released on bail, and hence the detention order\\nwill be illegal. However, there can be an exception to this rule,\\nthat is, where a co-accused whose case stands on the same\\nfooting had been granted bail. In such cases, the detaining\\nauthority can reasonably conclude that there is likelihood of the\\ndetenu being released on bail even though no bail application\\nof his is ending, since most courts normally grant bail on this\\nground. However, details of such alleged similar cases must be\\ngiven, otherwise the bald statement of the authority cannot\\nbe believed.”\\nThe said principles were also followed in the decision\\nrendered in Huidrom Konungjao Vs. State of Manipur & Ors., (2012)\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[9]\\n7 SCC 181 wherein it has been held that if such detention order is\\nchallenged, the detaining authority ought to satisfy the Court the following\\nfacts:\\n(i) the detaining authority was fully aware of the fact that detenu\\nwas actually in custody;\\n(ii) there was reliable materials before the said authority on the basis\\nof which it could have reasons to believe that there is reliable\\npossibility of released on bail and further on being released,\\nhe would probably indulge in activities which are prejudicial to\\nthe public order.\\nThe aforesaid principles have been reiterated and followed in\\nmany subsequent decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the High\\nCourts including the judgment and order dated 04-06-2013 passed by\\nthis Court in Elangbam Mangijao Singh Vs. State of Manipur & anr.,\\nW.P. (Cril.) No.10 of 2013\\n[7] In a case which arose from the State of Manipur, the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court had the occasion to go into the sufficiency of the\\nmaterials, relied upon by the detaining authority, to determine the validity of\\nthe order of detention. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, after the perusal of the\\ngrounds of detention and the documents relied upon by the detaining\\nauthority, came to the conclusion that they were not sufficient to form\\nsubjective satisfaction by the detaining authority. The said decision has\\nbeen rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Pabam Ningol Mikoi\\nDevi Vs. State of Manipur & ors.,(2010) 9 SCC 618 and para 27 thereof\\nwherein the materials have been enumerated, is as under:-\\n“27. In light of these decisions, to determine the validity of the detention\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[10]\\norder, it is necessary to go into the materials relied on by the\\ndetaining authority in passing the detention order. The documents\\nrelied upon by the District Magistrate, West Imphal, as mentioned in\\nthe grounds of detention dated 28-9-2009 are:\\n(a) The statement of the detenu given before the IO on 18-9-2009.\\n(b) Statement of SI T. Khogen Singh of CDO/IW recorded under\\nSection 161 CrPC in connection with FIR No.183 (9) 09\\nSJM-PS under Sections 17/20 of the Unlawful Activities\\n(Prevention) Act, 967.\\n(c) Statement of Rfm. No. 15007038 L. Rajen Singh of CDO/IW\\nrecorded under Section 161 CrPC in connection with FIR No.\\n183 (9) 09 SJM-PS under Sections 17/20 of the Unlawful\\nActivities (Prevention) Act, 1967.\\n(d) Statement of Constable No.0601193 S. Khomei Singh\\nrecorded under Section 161 CrPC in connection with FIR No.\\n183 (9) 09 SJM-PS under Sections 17/20 of the Unlawful\\nActivities (Prevention) Act, 1967.\\n(e) Copy of arrest memo dated 17-9-2009.\\n(f) Copy of seizure memo dated 17-9-2009.\\n(g) Copy of Manipur local daily The Poknapham dated 8-3-1999.\\n(h) Copy of Notification under No. S.O. 1922 (E) dated 13-11-2007.\\nAfter examining the aforesaid materials, the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court held:\\n“28. We are conscious of the fact that the grounds stated in the order\\nof detention are sufficient or not, is not within the ambit of the\\ndiscretion of the court and it is the subjective satisfaction of the\\ndetaining authority which is implied. However, if one of the\\ngrounds or reasons which lead to the subjective satisfaction of\\nthe detaining authority under the NS Act, is non-existent or\\nmisconceived or irrelevant, the order of detention would be\\ninvalid.\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[11]\\n29. Keeping in view these well-settled legal principles, we have\\nperused the grounds of detention and the documents relied on\\nby the detaining authority while passing the order of detention.\\nIn our considered view, the grounds on which the detention order\\nis passed has no probative value and were extraneous to the\\nscope, purpose and the object of the National Security Act. This\\nCourt in Mohd. Yousuf Rather v. State of J&K has observed that\\nunder Article 22(5), a detenu has two rights\\n(1) To be informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds on which\\nhis detention is based and\\n(2) To be afforded the earliest opportunity of making a\\nrepresentation against his detention.\\nThe inclusion of an irrelevant or non-existent ground among\\nother relevant grounds is an infringement of the first right and the\\ninclusion of an obscure or vague ground among other clear and\\ndefinite grounds is an infringement of the second right. No\\ndistinction can be made between introductory facts, background\\nfacts and “grounds” as such; if the actual allegations were vague\\nand irrelevant, detention would be rendered invalid.\\n30. Insofar as the documents on which reliance is placed, in our\\nopinion, none of these documents provide any reasonable basis\\nfor passing the detention order. The primary reliance has been\\non the accused’s own statement made to an investigating officer.\\nThis cannot be said to be sufficient to form the subjective\\nsatisfaction of the detaining authority. Statements under Section\\n161, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter CrPC)\\ncannot be taken as sufficient grounds in the absence of any\\nsupportive or corroborating grounds. Section 161 statements are\\nnot considered substantive evidence, but can only be used to\\ncontradict the witness in the course of a trial. The same is clear\\nfrom the wording of Section 162(1) CrPC and has been so held\\ntime and again by this Court.”\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[12]\\n[8] Keeping in mind the aforesaid principles, this Court proposes to\\nexamine the case on merit. As regards the sufficiency of the materials\\nrelied upon by the District Magistrate, it may be noted that they are\\nslightly different from that of the materials as considered by the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court in Pabam Ningol Mikoi Devi (supra). In the\\npresent case, there are statements given by the accomplices\\nimplicating the detenu as involved in the case registered by the\\nThoubal police and therefore, it cannot be said that the materials are\\nnot sufficient to pass the order of detention. But since the detenu was\\nadmittedly detained while in police custody, the other issue is as to\\nwhether the procedural safeguards have been observed by the District\\nMagistrate while passing the order of detention. On perusal of the order\\nof detention, it is clearly seen that it is nowhere mentioned therein that the\\nDistrict Magistrate was satisfied that the detenu was likely to be released\\non bail nor was it mentioned in the grounds of detention as well. Moreover,\\nthere is no material on record to show that at the time when the order of\\ndetention was passed by the District Magistrate, a bail application moved\\nby the detenu pertaining to the present case, was pending before the\\nappropriate Court and a copy thereof was placed before her by the\\nsponsoring authority nor has any co-accused been released on bail. The\\ngrant of bail would have been possible only when a bail application had\\nbeen filed by or on behalf of the detenu. It is not so in the present case.\\nThe District Magistrate, in her affidavit filed before this Court, did not say\\nanything about the materials on the basis of which she was satisfied that\\nthe detenu was likely to be released on bail and therefore, it is absolutely\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[13]\\nclear that the principles laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\\nUnion of India Vs. Paul Manickam (supra) have not been followed by\\nthe District Magistrate. The District Magistrate appears to have not\\napplied her judicious mind while passing the order of detention which is\\nviolative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Considering the\\nmaterials on record and having heard the learned counsels appearing for\\nthe parties, we are of the view that the order of detention is bad in law and\\nis liable to be quashed and set aside.\\n[9] In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the\\ninstant writ petition is allowed and consequently, the order of detention\\ndated 29-01-2020 passed by the District Magistrate, Thoubal District,\\nManipur is quashed and set aside with the direction that Mr. Kyaw Kyaw\\nNaing @ Addul Rahim (33 years) S/o Abdul Jabar @ Ula Sin of\\nKawhmu Village, Moha Rangoon, Myanmar shall be released forthwith, if\\nhe is not required for any other case.\\n[10] After having allowed the writ petition as aforesaid, this Court\\ndeems it appropriate to reiterate the observations made by this Court in\\nShri Sapam Kangleipal @ Chiranglen @ Sarat Vs. State of Manipur &\\nors, WP(Cril) No.9 of 2020, the paragraph 11 of which reads as under:\\n“[11] Before parting from the present case, this Court deems\\nit necessary and appropriate to make some observations as\\nregards the manner in which the orders of detention are passed\\nby the detaining authorities from time to time. It may be noted that\\nthere is hardly any case in which the Court has not interfered with\\nthe order of detention. In this regard, it may further be noted that\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[14]\\nHon’ble Mr. Justice N. Kotiswar Singh, the then Acting Chief\\nJustice of this Court, while agreeing with the judgment written by\\nhis esteem brother, made certain observations on 08-09-2017 in\\nWP (Cril.) No.5 of 2017, Ningthoujam Yamba Singh Vs. the\\nState of Manipur, the relevant paragraphs of which read as\\nunder:\\n“[12] This is not the first occasion where this Court had\\ndealt with such habeas corpus petitions challenging\\ndetention orders passed under the National Security Act,\\n1980 based on non application of mind as regards the\\nsatisfaction of the detaining authority that the detenu is\\nlikely to be released on bail in near future. In the past, on\\nsimilar ground, the detention orders had been set aside\\nand the Court directed release of the detenues. In many\\npetitions, similar issue was raised by the detenu that there\\nwas no material before the detaining authority to arrive at\\nthe satisfaction that the detenue who was already in\\ncustody is likely to be released on bail in the near future.\\nSome of such petitions where the detention orders were\\nset aside on the aforesaid ground are listed here below\\n(the list is not exhaustive):\\nDate of\\nSL.

(Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[17]\\ndecisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court rendered in\\nUnion of India –vs- Paul Manickam, (2003) 8\\nSCC342; 2004 SCC (Cril.) 239. In the case of Paul\\nManickam (supra), it has been held that\\n“14 … where detention orders are passed in relation\\nto persons who are already in jail under some other\\nlaws, the detaining authorities should apply their mind\\nand show their awareness in this regard in the grounds\\nof detention, the chances of release of such persons\\non bail. The necessity of keeping such persons in\\ndetention under the preventive detention laws has\\nto be clearly indicated. Subsisting custody of the\\ndetenu by itself does not invalidate an order of his\\npreventive detention, and the decision in this regard\\nmust depend on the facts of the particular case.\\nPreventive detention being necessary to prevent the\\ndetenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the\\nsecurity of the State or to the maintenance of public\\norder or economic stability, etc. Ordinarily, it is not\\nneeded when the detenu is already in custody. The\\ndetaining authority must show its awareness to the fact\\nof subsisting custody of the detenu and take that factor\\ninto account while making the order. If the detaining\\nauthority is reasonably satisfied with cogent materials\\nthat there is likelihood of his release and in view of his\\nantecedent activities which are proximate in point of\\ntime, he must be detained in order to prevent him\\nfrom indulging in such prejudicial activities, the\\ndetention order can be validly made. Where the\\ndetention order in respect of a person already in\\ncustody does not indicate that the detenu was likely to\\nbe released on bail, the order would be vitiated\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[18]\\n……The point was gone into detail in Kamarunnisasa v.\\nUnion of India: (1991) 1 SCC 128: 1991 SCC (Crl) 88.\\nThe principles were set out as follows : even in the case\\nof a person in custody, a detention order can be validly\\npassed : (1) if the authority passing the order is aware\\nof the fact that he is actually in custody; (2) if he has a\\nreason to believe on the basis of reliable material\\nplaced before him (a) that there is a real possibility of\\nhis release on bail, and (b) that on being released, he\\nwould in all probability indulge in prejudicial activities;\\nand (3) if it is felt essential to detain him to prevent him\\nfrom so doing. If an order is passed after recording\\nsatisfaction in that regard, the order would be valid. In\\nthe case at hand the order of detention and grounds of\\ndetention show an awareness of custody and /or a\\npossibility of released on bail.”\\n[14] Accordingly, this Court, having observed that the\\ndetaining authority and the other concerned authorities\\nhave not been properly applying the law as laid down in\\nthe aforesaid decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,\\nin W.P.(CRIL). No.37 of 2013 which was disposed of on\\n01.4.2014, made the following observations and issued\\nthe direction as follows:\\n“(6) We are, therefore, of the view that in absence of\\nany bail application on behalf of the petitioner pending\\nbefore the Court for being released on bail in the criminal\\ncase in which he had been taken to police custody, there\\ncould not be any apprehension in the mind of the District\\nMagistrate that the petitioner may be released on bail\\nmerely because in similar cases some accused persons\\nhad been released on bail earlier. We are, therefore,\\nfurther of the view that in absence of any bail application\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[19]\\non behalf of the petitioner pending consideration by the\\nCourt, the order of detention passed by the District\\nMagistrate, becomes invalid.\\n(7) Before parting with the case, we should like to\\nobserve that similar cases had come up for\\nconsideration before us earlier and several judgments\\nhave been delivered quashing the detention solely on the\\nabove ground. The District Magistrate, while passing such\\norders of detention, are not taking note of the judgment of\\nthe Supreme Court rendered in the case of Rekha Vs.\\nState of Tamil Nadu & Ors. (supra) as well as the\\njudgments passed by this Court in several cases setting\\naside such orders of detention solely on the above\\nground. We, therefore, direct that the Chief Secretary,\\nGovernment of Manipur shall circulate a copy of the\\njudgment delivered in the case of Rekha Vs. State of\\nTamil Nadu & Ors. (supra) quoted above, along with a\\ncopy of this judgment to all the District Magistrates for\\ntheir perusal and guidance in future. Copy of this judgment\\nand copy of the judgment in the case of Rekha (supra) be\\ncommunicated to the Chief Secretary forthwith.”\\n[15] Subsequently also, when this Court noted that a large\\nnumber of detention orders passed under the National\\nSecurity Act,1980 had been quashed on the similar ground\\nand felt that the law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme\\nCourt as referred to above were not being adhered to by the\\ndetaining authorities, this Court again made the following\\nobservation and direction in W.P.(CRIL) No. 37 of 2016\\nwhich was disposed of on 03.10.2016:\\n“[14] Thus, we find that subjective satisfaction of the\\ndetaining authority of likelihood of the accused being\\nreleased on bail is not based on any factual aspect and\\nthereby order of detention being bad, is hereby\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[20]\\nquashed. Consequently, the detenu Wahengbam\\nRamananda @ Luwangngamba @ Rousow s/o (L) W.\\nBiren Singh of Kontha Ahallup Makha Leikai, PS Heingang,\\nis hereby directed to be released forthwith, if not wanted\\nin connection with any other case\\n[15] Before parting with this order, it be recorded that\\nearlier when we did find in another case that order of\\ndetention is being passed without having regard to the\\nprovisions of the Act and also of several decisions\\nrendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court indicating\\ntherein the manner in which the order of detention be\\npassed, we, after discussing the issue in details in\\ncontext of different decisions of the Supreme Court,\\npassed order of communicating the said order to the\\nDistrict Magistrates and Superintendents of Police for their\\nguidelines to be observed while passing the order of\\ndetention, we are constrained to say that it is being not\\nadhered to by the detaining authority and therefore the\\nmatter needs to be brought to the notice of the Chief\\nSecretary for doing needful in the matter. Accordingly,\\ncopy of this order be communicated to the Chief Secretary,\\nGovt. of Manipur. Thus, this application stands allowed.”\\nSimilar directions were issued in W.P.(Cril) No.35 of\\n2016 and W.P.(Cril) No. 36 of 2016.\\n[16] However, we are constrained to say that in spite of\\nsuch observations and directions issued by this Court on\\nearlier occasions as mentioned above, the detaining\\nauthorities and other concerned authorities continue to issue\\ndetention orders with similar deficiencies indicating that they\\nhave not properly applied their mind in violation of the law\\nlaid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court as referred to\\nabove, resulting in quashing of the detention orders by the\\nCourt.\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[21]\\n[17] It may be noted that most of the persons who have\\nbeen detained under the National Security Act in Manipur\\nhave been accused of being members of or associated with\\nvarious outlawed organizations and of having committed\\nserious heinous crimes.\\nAccordingly, while allowing this petition by setting\\naside the impugned detention order dated 06.02.2017, we\\ndirect that notice be issued to the Chief Secretary,\\nGovernment of Manipur; Director General of Police,\\nManipur; Commissioner/ Secretary (Home), Government of\\nManipur to explain before this Court as to what steps they\\nhad taken earlier in compliance of the earlier directions\\nissued by this Court in W.P.(Cril) No. 37 of 2013 as well as\\nin W.P.(Cril) No.37 of 2016 by filing their respective\\naffidavits before this Court within a period of one month\\nfrom today with the copies of relevant instructions issued by\\nthe authorities in this regard, if any.\\nWe hereby reiterate that the copies of the judgments\\ndelivered in (1) Union of India –vs- Paul Manickam,\\n(2003) 8 SCC 342; 2004 SCC (Cril.) 239, (2) Rekha –vs-\\nState of Tamil Nadu & Ors. (2011) 4 SCC 260 and (3)\\nHuidrom Konungjao –vs- State of Manipur & Ors. (2012)\\n7 SCC 181 be circulated to all the Superintendents of\\nPolice, Deputy Commissioner/ District Magistrates of all the\\nDistricts for strict compliance of the law laid down in the\\naforesaid judgments and if necessary, the Chief\\nSecretary of the State may organize training programmes\\nof the Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of\\nPolice through the State Academy of Training (SAT) or\\nany such body as it may be deemed fit.\\nIt may be also noted that this Court may be constrained\\nto pass appropriate orders in future against those persons\\nresponsible for issuing defective detention orders by way of\\nW.P. (Cril.) No. 3 of 2020 Contd.../-[22]\\nimposing exemplary costs who continue to issue such\\ndefective orders as these defective orders may amount to\\nillegally detaining persons and violating their Fundamental\\nRight as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.”\\n[12] The officials of the State Government and in particular,\\nthe detaining authorities appear to have not yet taken into\\naccount the said observations seriously while passing the orders\\nof detention. Therefore, the Chief Secretary, Manipur is directed\\nto re-look into the matter without fail and issue appropriate\\ninstructions to the detaining authorities, at the earliest possible,\\nso as to avoid any order being passed by this Court imposing\\nheavy costs upon the detaining authorities for violating the\\nprovisions of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. A copy of this\\njudgment and order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary, Manipur,\\nthrough his e-mail/WhatsApp for doing the needful.”\\n[11] As a reminder, a copy of this judgment and order may be sent to\\nthe Chief Secretary, Manipur either through a messenger or his e-mail/\\nWhatsApp for his perusal and necessary action.\\nJUDGE JUDGE\\nFR/NFR\\nDevananda\\nW.P.

In\\nterms of the letter of the Director(Social Welfare), Manipur, dated\\n23.09.2017, all the Contractors/Bidders including the appellant/writ\\npetitioner submitted their respective justification for the price bids tendered\\nby them.\\n[8] After receiving the justifications of the respective price bids\\nsubmitted by all the bidders, the HTC re-examined the rates quoted in the\\nfinancial bids in the light of the analysis done by the Social Welfare\\nDepartment in its meeting held on 16.12.2017. The HTC was of the view\\nthat the lowest quoted rate among the existing contract in FCI which is Rs.\\n8.95 Per Metric Tone Per Kilometre could be considered as bench marked\\nand 30% variation from the bench marked rate i.e., Rs. 6.265 Per MT Per\\nKM to Rs. 11.635 Per MT Per KM could be an acceptable band of rate and\\nthat within this acceptable band of rate, only the L1 quoted rate for route\\nVIII was found to be within the acceptable band of rate.

The learned\\nGovernment Advocate also submitted that after passing of the interim order\\ndated 19.12.2018 by this Court in the present batches of writ appeals\\nallowing the appellant/writ petitioner and the private respondents, i.e., M/S\\nB.L.L. Agency and M/S B.L.L. Enterprises, to execute the said contract\\nW.A. No. 26 of 2018, W.A. No. 27 of 2018, W.A. No. 28 of 2018, W.A. No. 44 of 2018,\\nW.P. (C) No. 995 of 2018& W.P. (C) No. 1062 of 2018 Page 18work as notified in the NIT, the State Government had issued acceptance\\nletter dated 11.01.2019 and the said 3(three) contractors have entered into\\nan agreement with the State Government on 14.01.2019 and 17.01.2019\\nfor executing the said contract work. The learned Government Advocate\\nfurther submitted that as required by the terms and conditions of the NIT in\\nPara No. VIII under the heading Security Deposit, the said 3(three)\\ncontractors have revalidated the bank guarantee of Rs. 20(Twenty) Lakhs\\nin order to lift and transport the WBNP(Rice) from FCI depot to various\\noffices of the Social Welfare Department. It is also submitted by the learned\\ncounsel that the said 3(three) contractors have already lifted the\\nWBNP(Rice) for altogether 6(six) quarters even though the contract work is\\nfor lifting of WBNP(Rice) for 4(four) quarters only. It is accordingly\\nsubmitted by the learned Government Advocate that counting from the date\\nof lifting and transporting of WBNP(Rice) by the appellant/writ petitioner\\nM/S R.K. & Co. and the private respondents M/S B.L.L Agency and M/S\\nB.L.L Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., the one year period of contract provided in the\\nNIT dated 22.06.2017 had already been completed and over.\\nMr. S. Nepolean, learned Government Advocate submitted\\nthat as the said contract work had been given and allowed to be executed\\nby 3(three) contractors, including the present appellant/writ petitioner and\\nthe private respondents, the issue involved in the present cases no longer\\nsurvives and as such, the present batches of cases have now become\\ninfructuous. The learned Government Advocate accordingly prayed that the\\nW.A. No. 26 of 2018, W.A. No. 27 of 2018, W.A. No. 28 of 2018, W.A. No. 44 of 2018,\\nW.P. (C) No. 995 of 2018& W.P. (C) No. 1062 of 2018 Page 19State Government may be allowed to issue a fresh NIT for transportation of\\nfood grains under the WBNP.\\n[26] Countering the submissions made by the learned Government\\nAdvocate, Mr. HS. Paonam, learned senior counsel, vehemently submitted\\nthat under Para No. VII of the terms and conditions governing the contract\\nenclosed in the NIT dated 22.06.2017, it is clearly provided that the\\ncontract shall remain in force for a period of 1(one) year with option of\\nextension for a further period of 1(one) year at the sole discretion of the\\nGovernment without any escalation in rate from the date of the acceptance\\nletter or such latter date as may be decided by the Director or any Officers\\nauthorised by the Government. The learned senior counsel accordingly\\nsubmitted that as provided under Para(VII) of the terms and conditions\\ngoverning the contract, the period of contract should be for 1(one) year\\nfrom the date of the acceptance letter and since the process of tender has\\nnot yet been completed and no letter of acceptance has been issued, it\\ncannot be contended that the period of contract has already been over and\\nthe submissions made by the learned Government Advocate are without\\nany basis. The learned senior counsel accordingly made detailed\\nsubmissions on the merit of the cases.\\nMr. Kh. Tarunkumar, learned counsel appearing for the\\nprivate respondents also made similar submissions advanced by Mr. HS.\\nPaonam.\\nW.A. No. 26 of 2018, W.A. No. 27 of 2018, W.A. No. 28 of 2018, W.A. No. 44 of 2018,\\nW.P. (C) No. 995 of 2018& W.P. (C) No. 1062 of 2018 Page 20[27] It has to be kept in mind that the Ministry of Women and Child\\nDevelopment, Government of India, allocated food grains to the State\\nGovernments and Union Territories under the Wheat Based Nutrition\\nProgramme(WBNP) periodically in every quarter of a year. The period of\\n1(one) year is divided into 4(four) quarters comprising of 3(three) months\\neach. As per the guidelines issued by the Government, the lifting and\\ndistribution of the food grains allocated for a particular quarter is to be\\ncarried out within 3(three) months or within the particular quarter of the\\nyear. If for any reasons, the State Government failed to lift and distribute\\nthe food grains under the WBNP, the quota of food grains allocated to the\\nState Government for that particular Quarter will lapsed, resulting in\\ndepriving the beneficiaries, such as malnourished children and lactating\\nmothers, to get their shares of food grains and other Micronutrients entitled\\nto them.\\nKeeping in view, such schemes for distribution of food grains\\nunder the WBNP, we are of the considered view that the work for lifting of\\nsuch food grains from the concerned depots and thereafter, distribution to\\nthe beneficiaries cannot be delayed or stopped and should be regularly\\ncarried out and completed in time.\\n[28] In the nature of a contract work for construction of buildings,\\nbridges, roads, etc., unless and until the constructions are carried out, then\\nit can validly be said that the contract works have not been executed or\\ncarried out. However, in the nature of the contract work for transportation of\\nW.A. No. 26 of 2018, W.A. No. 27 of 2018, W.A. No. 28 of 2018, W.A. No. 44 of 2018,\\nW.P. (C) No. 995 of 2018& W.P.

Any lapses in carrying out such\\ntransportation and distribution will result in denying the beneficiaries, such\\nas malnourished children and lactating mothers, from getting their share of\\nfood grains and Micronutrients under the WBNP.\\nIn view of the nature of the contract work involved in the\\npresent cases, we cannot agree with the submission made by Mr. H.S.\\nPaonam, learned senior Advocate, that the contract work for transportation\\nof food grains under the WBNP for a period of 1(one) year as notified in the\\nNIT dated 22.06.2017 have not been executed or carried out.\\n[29] After hearing the rival submissions advanced by the counsels\\nappearing for the parties and after perusal of the records, we find that on\\nthe consent of the parties in the present batches of cases, this Court\\npassed an interim order on 19.12.2018 in W.A.

After completing the necessary formalities, the appellant/writ\\npetitioner and the private respondents have been executing the contract\\nwork of transporting food grains under the WBNP for the last about 2(two)\\nyears, even though the period of contract is only for 1(one) year. Since the\\ncontract work for transportation of good grains under the WBNP as notified\\nin the NIT had already been carried out and executed for the last about\\n2(two) years, we are of the considered view that issues raised in the\\npresent cases no longer survives and all these batches of cases have\\nbecome infructuous.\\nAccordingly, we dispose of the present batches of cases with\\nthe following directions:-\\n(a) The State Government and in particular, the\\nSocial Welfare Department shall take up\\nimmediate steps and issue fresh NIT for\\ntransportation of food grains and Micronutrients\\nunder the WBNP within a period of 10(ten) days\\nfrom the date of receipt of a copy of this\\njudgment and order;\\n(b) The whole tender process including the issuance\\nof work order should be completed within\\nW.A.

No. 6 of 2017P age | 3\\n(iv) Stay the arrest of the petitioner by the respondent\\ntill the disposal of the petition.”\\n[4] Pending Criminal Petition No.6 of 2017, the petitioner\\nherein has filed the present petition viz., M.C. (Crl. Petn.) No.6 of\\n2018, seeking to implead her in the main Criminal Petition stating\\nthat on 23.7.2009, the son of the petitioner viz., Chungkham Sanjit\\nMeitei, was killed by the Manipur Police Commando personnel in a\\nfake encounter. On 1.8.2009, a English weekly magazine “Tehelka”\\npublished an exclusive report about the killing of the petitioner’s son\\nby the Manipur Police Commando personnel in a fake encounter.\\nThereafter, the petitioner lodged a written report with the Officer-\\nincharge of City Police Station. However, the police refused to\\nregister the FIR without assigning any reason. Thereafter, on\\n17.8.2009, the petitioner has filed a writ petition before the then\\nGauhati High Court, Imphal Bench against non-registration of FIR.\\nBy an order dated 25.8.2009, Gauhati High Court, Imphal Bench\\npassed an interim order directing the Officer-in-charge of the City\\nPolice Station to lodge an FIR based on the written report submitted\\nby the petitioner. Accordingly, the police has registered the case\\nunder FIR No.82(8)2009 City PS under Sections 32/34 IPC and\\n27(3) of Arms Act for investigation.\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 4\\n[5] It is further stated that by an order dated 23.12.2009,\\nthe Gauhati High Court, Imphal Bench entrusted the investigation to\\nthe CBI to investigate into the FIR. Pursuant to the order of the\\nCourt, the CBI investigated into the incident of killing of the\\npetitioner’s son and filed its charge sheet in the court of the learned\\nChief Judicial Magistrate, Imphal West against 9 police personnel of\\nManipur. After getting committal from the learned Chief Judicial\\nMagistrate, the trial Court framed charges against 9 police\\npersonnel and at present more than 90 prosecution witnesses have\\nbeen examined. In the mean time, on 25.1.2016, accused No.3 viz,\\nThounaojam Herojit Singh, made an extra legal confession through\\nprint and electronic media stating inter alia that he killed\\nChungkham Sanjit Meitei on 23.7.2009 as ordered by his superior\\nDr. Akoijam Jhalajit Singh, the first respondent herein and the said\\nconfessional statement of accused No.3 was also published in one\\nof the local dailies of Manipur. According to the petitioner, her son\\nwas killed by accused No.3 as per the direction given by the first\\nrespondent. However, the first respondent preferred the Criminal\\npetition seeking various reliefs in order to avoid from criminal\\ninvestigation against him in connection with the killing of petitioner’s\\nson. According to the petitioner, there would be a serious\\ninconvenience and it would hamper the task of further investigation\\ninto the matter if the first respondent is not made available to the\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 5\\nInvestigating Officer for effective questioning including custodial\\ninterrogation. Thus, the custodial interrogation of the first\\nrespondent at the earliest is highly required after rejecting the\\nCriminal Petition preferred by him. The petitioner has a real and\\nsubsisting interest in the subject matter of the present proceedings\\nand, therefore, she has to be impleaded as respondent No.2 in the\\nCriminal Petition preferred by the first respondent herein.\\n[6] The first respondent has filed opposition affidavit\\nstating that the petitioner has no legal right to be heard as party\\nrespondent in Criminal Petition No.6 of 2017 and she is trying to\\ntake over the control of the prosecution side by indirectly entering\\ninto the array in the Criminal Petition. It is stated that the present\\npetition has been filed by the petitioner in order to obstruct the\\nadministration of justice and the same is not maintainable and\\nprayed for dismissal of the petition.\\n[7] The second respondent-CBI filed opposition affidavit\\ncontending that the CBI, SC-II Branch has filed petition for further\\ninvestigation in the matter and the trail Court, by order dated\\n14.02.2017 granted permission for further investigation. It is stated\\nthat since almost 105 witnesses were examined in the present\\ncase, it is prerogative of the Court to take appropriate decision in\\nthe matter.\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 6\\n[8] Heard Mr. Shreeji Bhavsar, the learned counsel for the\\npetitioner; Mr. Jayant Sud, learned Sr. counsel for the first\\nrespondent and Mr. S. Biswajit, the learned counsel for the second\\nrespondent.\\n[9] The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in\\norder to escape from the clutches of criminal investigation initiated\\nagainst him in connection with the killing of petitioner’s son, the first\\nrespondent has filed Criminal Petition No.6 of 2017 and at present\\nthe first respondent is enjoying the interim order passed by this\\nCourt and the trial Court has continued the trial and examined so far\\n99 prosecution witnesses and the examination of the prosecution\\nwitnesses is going to be completed very soon during the pendency\\nof the Criminal Petition filed by the first respondent. According to\\nthe learned counsel, there would be a serious inconvenience and\\nhampering of further investigation into the matter if the first\\nrespondent is not made available to the Investigating Officer for\\neffective questioning including custodial interrogation. Therefore,\\nthe presence of the petitioner is necessary in order to enable the\\nCourt to effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all\\nquestions involved in the Criminal Petition. No prejudice would be\\ncaused to the first respondent, if the petitioner is impleaded as party\\nrespondent in the Criminal Petition preferred by him.\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 7\\n[10] Per contra, the learned counsel for the first respondent\\nsubmitted that by adding the petitioner herein as party respondent\\nin the Criminal Petition, great prejudice would be caused to the first\\nrespondent as the petitioner is trying to take over the prosecution by\\nnot following the due process of law contrary to the criminal\\njurisprudence. He would submit that the petitioner has no locus\\nstandi to file the present petition.\\n[11] The learned counsel for the second respondent\\nsubmitted that the Court may pass order as deemed fit and proper\\nin the facts and circumstances of the case.\\n[12] I have considered the submissions made by the\\nlearned counsel appearing on either side and also perused the\\nmaterials available on record.\\n[13] The grievance of the petitioner is that she has to be\\nimpleaded as second respondent in Criminal Petition No.6 of 2017\\nfiled by the first respondent as she is necessary party to the said\\nproceedings and it is duty of the trial Court to hear the petitioner. In\\nsupport, the learned counsel relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court in J.K International v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)\\nand others, reported in (2001) 3 SCC 462.\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 8\\n[14] In J.K International, supra, the Hon’ble Supreme Court\\nheld as under:\\n“13. We may now proceed to point out the\\nusefulness of the observations made by the\\nthree-judge bench in Bhagwant Singh vs.\\ncommissioner of Police (supra) Bhagwati J. (as\\nhe then was) who spoke for the bench pointed\\nout that the informant having taken the initiative\\nin lodging the First Information Report with a\\nview to initiate investigation by the police for the\\npurpose of ascertaining whether any offence\\nhas been committed (if so by whom) is vitally\\ninterested in the result of the investigation and\\nhence the law requires that the action taken by\\nthe officer-in-charge of the police station on\\nsuch FIR should be communicated to him. The\\nbench said this with reference to Section\\n173(2)(i) of the Code.\\n14. This Court further said in the decision that if\\nthe magistrate finds that there is no sufficient\\nground for proceeding further the informant\\nwould certainly be prejudiced because the FIR\\nwas lodged by him. After adverting to different\\nclauses of Section 173 of the Code learned\\njudges laid down the legal proposition in\\nparagraph 5 of the said judgment. The law so\\nlaid down is that through there is no obligation\\non the Magistrate to issue notice to the injured\\nperson or to a relative of the deceased in order\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 9\\nto provide him an opportunity to be heard at the\\ntime of consideration of the final report of the\\npolice (except when the final report is to the\\neffect that no offence had been made out in the\\ncase) the informant who lodged the FIR is\\nentitled to a notice from the Magistrate. In other\\ninstances, the injured or any relative of the\\naccused can appear before the Magistrate at\\nthe time of consideration of the police report if\\nsuch person otherwise comes to know that the\\nMagistrate is going to consider the report. If\\nsuch person appears before the Magistrate it is\\nthe duty of the Magistrate to hear him. It is\\nprofitable to extract the relevant portion of that\\nratio:\\n“The injured person or any relative of the\\ndeceased, though not entitled to notice from the\\nMagistrate, has locus to appear before the\\nmagistrate at the time of consideration of the\\nreport, if he otherwise comes to know that the\\nreport is going to be considered by the\\nMagistrate and if he wants to make his\\nsubmissions in regard to the report, the\\nMagistrate is bound to hear him. We may also\\nobserve that even though the Magistrate is not\\nbound to give notice of the hearing fixed for\\nconsideration of the report to the injured person\\nor to any relative of the deceased, he may, in\\nthe exercise of his discretion, if he so thinks fit,\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 10\\ngive such notice to the injured person or to any\\nparticular relative or relatives of the deceased,\\nbut not giving of such notice will not have any\\ninvalidating effect on the order which may be\\nmade by the Magistrate on a consideration of\\nthe report.”\\n15. In the above view of the matter learned\\nsingle judge has done wrong to the appellant\\nwhen he closed the door of the High Court\\nbefore him by saying that the High Court is\\ngoing to consider whether the criminal\\nproceedings initiated at his behest should be\\nquashed completely and that the complainant\\nwould not be heard at all even if he wants to be\\nheard.\\n16. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set\\naside the impugned order. The petition filed by\\nthe respondents for quashing the criminal\\nproceedings can now be disposed of by the\\nHigh Court after affording a reasonable\\nopportunity to this appellant also to be heard in\\nthe matter.”\\n[15] In the case on hand, the first respondent has not\\napproached the High Court for quashing the criminal proceedings\\ninitiated by the prosecution. On the other hand, he has filed\\nCriminal Petition No.6 of 2017 under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 11\\ndirection from this Court to set aside the order of the learned\\nSessions Judge, Imphal West dated 14.02.2017 and to stay the\\narrest of the first respondent by the second respondent till the\\ndisposal of the petition. Therefore, the citation mentioned supra\\nproduced by the counsel for the petitioner is not applicable in the\\ncase on hand.\\n[16] It is seen from the opposition affidavit of the second\\nrespondent that before the Sessions Court, Imphal West, so far 105\\nprosecution witnesses have been examined and in the light of the\\nadditional information received to the effect that the accused\\nThounaojam Herojit Singh, Head Constable has claimed to have\\nkilled the deceased Chungkham Sanjit on the orders of the Frist\\nRespondent and additional facts disclosed by the petitioner herein,\\nit was decided by the CBI to conduct further investigation in the\\ncase. Accordingly, an application for further investigation in the\\ncase by CBI, SC-II Branch was filed before the trial Court and\\npermission was granted for further investigation by the order dated\\n14.02.2017.\\n[17] Admittedly, the petitioner has no locus standi to file the\\npresent Miscellaneous Petition. As per the Criminal Procedure\\nCode, the right of the petitioner as a complainant in the trial is to file\\nan application before the concerned Sessions Court under Section\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 12\\n301 and 302 of Cr.P.C. to participate during the prosecution of the\\ncase through a legal counsel of her choice. As stated supra,\\nadmittedly, before the trial Court, 105 prosecution witnesses have\\nbeen examined and the trial is likely to be completed and at this\\nstage, if the petition of the petitioner is entertained, it would amount\\nto obstruction to the administration of justice.\\n[18] It appears that earlier the petitioner has approached\\nthe Court with a prayer for further investigation in S.T.No.7 of\\n2010/57 of 2015 and the same were disposed of by the Court. As\\nagainst the order passed therein, the petitioner has not preferred\\nany appeal and the issue attained finality as far as the petitioner’s\\ncase is concerned. It also appears that neither the second\\nrespondent, nor the petitioner established any new evidence or\\ncorroborated material particulars after the commencement of the\\ntrial for any further investigation.\\n[19] Since the trail of the case is in the advance stage and\\n105 prosecution witnesses out of 254 have already been examined\\nby the trial Court, in my considered view, there is no necessity to\\nimplead the petitioner as respondent No.2 in Criminal Petition No.6\\nof 2017, as her impleadment will not prolong the trial proceedings.\\nThis Court has not gone into the merits and de-merits of the petition\\npreferred by the first respondent in Criminal Petition No.6 of 2017 in\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017P age | 13\\nthe present petition. This Court has considered only the issue\\nwhether the petitioner is to be impleaded as second respondent and\\nimpleadment of the petitioner is really required in Criminal Petition\\nNo.6 of 2017. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, this\\nCourt found that there is no necessity to implead the petitioner as\\nrespondent No.2 in Criminal Petition No.6 of 2017. As rightly argued\\nby the learned counsel for the CBI, no prejudice is likely to be\\ncaused to any party by the ongoing trial as the grievance of the\\npetitioner for further investigation has already been addressed. The\\npetitioner has no real and subsisting interest in the subject matter of\\nCriminal Petition No.6 of 2017 as the issue to be adjudicated in the\\nsaid petition is between the first respondent and the second\\nrespondent and in that proceedings, the petitioner is not a\\nnecessary party to be heard and impleaded.\\n[20] In view of the above discussion, I am of the view that\\nthe present Miscellaneous Petition is devoid of merits as the\\npetitioner has no locus standi to seek impleadment in Criminal\\npetition No.6 of 2017. Accordingly, MC (Crl. Petn.) No.6 of 2018 is\\ndismissed.\\nJUDGE\\nFR/NFR\\nLynda\\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 6 of 2018\\nRef:-Cril.Petn. No. 6 of 2017',\n",

The factum of having received a total sum of\\nRs. 3,64,461/- (Rupees three lakhs sixty four thousand and four hundred\\nsixty one) was recorded in the summary report prepared by the District\\nElection Officer, Bishnupur. The receipt of donation for a sum of\\nRs.3,00,000/- (Rupees three lakhs) and Rs. 63,500/- (Rupees sixty\\nthree thousand and five hundred) by cash on 10.03.2017 and\\n11.03.2017 by the respondent No.1 as reflected in his Abstract\\nStatement of Election Expenses dated 10.04.2017, amounted to\\ncommission of corrupt practice within the meaning of Section 123(6) of\\nthe Act, 1951. Hence, the election of the respondent No.1 is illegal and\\nis liable to be set aside under Section 100(1)(b) of the Act, 1951. As per\\nthe provisions of Section 33 and 33(A) of the Act, 1951 read with Rule\\n4A of the Conduct of the Elections Rules, 1961, a candidate is required\\nto file an affidavit duly sworn to along with his nomination paper.\\nSecondly, the respondent No.1 made a false declaration / statement in\\nhis affidavit dated 13.02.2017, filed along with his nomination paper,\\npertaining to his liabilities towards financial Institutions/ Bank. He took a\\nM.C.(Elec. Petn.) No. 14 of 2018[5]\\nloan for a sum of Rs.10,00,00/- (Rupees ten lakhs) from the State Bank\\nof India for buying a motor car/ vehicle which he failed to purchase and\\nIn addition thereto, he obtained another loan of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees\\nfive lakhs) only being the advance for purchase of a motor car and this\\ntime too, no motor car was purchased by him. These facts were not\\ndisclosed by the respondent No.1 in his affidavit dated 13.02.2017 filed\\nbefore the Returning Officer who ought to have rejected such\\nnomination but since his nomination was not rejected by the Returning\\nOfficer, the respondent No.1 was allowed to contest the election. Due to\\nimproper acceptance of the nomination paper of the respondent No.1 by\\nthe Returning Officer, the result of the election in so far as it concerns\\nwith the respondent No.1 had been materially affected and therefore, a\\nprayer had been made to declare the election of the respondent No.1\\nas returned candidate as null and void.\\n[5] In the written statement, it has been stated by the respondent\\nNo.1 that the receipt of donation of Rs.3 Lakhs and Rs.63,500/- and a\\nloan amount of Rs. 961/- ( Rupees nine hundred and sixty one) did not\\nviolate the direction of the Election Commission of India, in view of the\\nfact that the alleged donation amounts were not from a single person.\\nAs regards the donation amount of 3 lakhs, it was donated by 20\\n(twenty) well wishers of the respondent No.1-each donating Rs.15,000/-\\n(Rupees fifteen thousand) and similarly, the donation amount of\\nRs.63,500/- was donated by 5 (five) well wishers of the respondent No.1\\nwhose donation amount did not cross the ceiling limit of Rs. 20,000/- as\\nM.C.(Elec. Petn.) No. 14 of 2018[6]\\nper the instructions of the Election Commission of India (ECI). In this\\nregard, the additional election agent of the respondent No.1 vide his\\nletter dated 02.04.2017, in response to the notice of the Returning\\nOfficer dated 11.04.2017, furnished the explanation about the said\\ndonations and loans mentioned in the election petition and the\\nsatisfaction of the concerned authority was reflected in the scrutiny\\nreport of the District Election Officer on election expenses of the\\ncandidates under Rule 89 of C.E Rule,1961 with the remark that the\\ncandidate had rectified the defect. Since the ECI had accepted the\\nexplanation, there was no question of the instructions of the ECI being\\nviolated and that a receipt of such donation did not amount to\\ncommission of corrupt practice under Section 123(6) of the Act, 1951.\\nAs regards the loan taken by the respondent No.1 for a sum of Rs.10\\nlakhs and another sum of Rs.5 lakhs form SBI, the deductions made out\\nof it by the bank, were reflected in the annexure A/4 and A/5 of the\\nelection petition meaning thereby that there had been a total\\noutstanding loan amount of Rs.11,61,145/- which was clearly mentioned\\nin the affidavit of the respondent No.1 and therefore, there was no\\nquestion of non-disclosure about the said loans and in particular, the\\noutstanding loan amount. The allegation made by the applicant/\\npetitioner that the respondent no.1 made false statement in affidavit\\ndated 13.02.2017, was absolutely incorrect.\\n[6] Since both the parties have failed to specify the new facts as\\nalleged by them as stated hereinabove, this court has no option but to\\nM.C.(Elec.

Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 2\\nJUDGMENT AND ORDER\\n(CAV)\\n(M.V. Muralidaran, J)\\nThis appeal arises out of the judgment in Sessions\\nTrial Case No.10 of 2007 convicting the appellant under Section\\n302 IPC and sentencing her to undergo life imprisonment for the\\nproved charge of murder of her own father Khosole Poumei.\\n2. The case of the prosecution is that on 16.4.2003 at\\nabout 12.30 P.M., Khosole Poumei was found killed by his\\ndaughter viz., the appellant/accused herein by hitting with an axe\\nhandle on the head over a family feud at their residence and after\\nthe commission of the crime, the appellant ran away to the jungle\\nand concealed herself leaving the weapon of the crime at the spot.\\n3. On the basis of the complaint lodged by P.W.2-Dale,\\nwho was the then Chairman of Taphou Phyamei Village, an FIR\\nCase No.4(4)2003 was registered by Senapati Police Station\\nunder Section 302 IPC against the appellant. P.W.3-Investigating\\nOfficer took up the investigation of the case and P.W.3, his team\\nrushed to the occurrence place. On reaching the occurrence spot,\\nP.W.3 found the dead body of Khosole Poumei lying in a pool of\\nblood. Thereafter, P.W.3 prepared rough sketch and had\\nconducted inquest on the body of the deceased. P.W.3 examined\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 3\\nthe witnesses P.W.2-Dale and P.W.4-K.S.Stephen, the then\\nSecretary of Taphou Pohyamei Village and recorded their\\nstatements. P.W.3 had also seized M.O.2-handle of axe, which\\nwas used for the crime in the presence of same witnesses under\\nseizure mahazar, where P.W.5-Saloni had also put his signature.\\nThereafter, P.W.3 sent the body for autopsy.\\n4. P.W.1-Dr.Adaphro, attached with Senapati District\\nHospital had conducted autopsy on the dead body of Khosole\\nPoumei and noticed the following external injuries:\\n\\uf0b7 Laceration of the scalp,\\n\\uf0b7 fracture of the scalp bone (occipital bone)\\nP.W.1-Doctor also found the following internal preferences:\\n\\uf0b7 Scalp laceration (Rt.

Occipital area)\\n\\uf0b7 Meninces and Vessels Severed\\n\\uf0b7 Brain - lacerated\\nP.W.1 has given opinion as to the cause of death as homicidal in\\nnature. After completing the post-mortem, the body was handed\\nover to the relatives of the deceased for performing last rites.\\nEx.P1 is the post-mortem certificate issued by P.W.1.\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 4\\n5. On 18.4.2003, on receiving reliable information, the\\nInvestigating Officer rushed to the area where the\\nappellant/accused was hiding at about 9.00 AM. on 18.4.2003, the\\nInvestigating Officer found the appellant surrounded by the\\nvillagers. Thereafter, the Investigating Officer arrested the\\nappellant and obtained her confessional statementEx.P4 in the\\npresence of P.W.2 and P.W.4. The Investigating Officer had also\\nseized a blood stained shirt, which was worn by the appellant at\\nthe time of arrest under Ex.P5 in the presence of witnesses. P.W.3\\nhad also sent the blood stained seized shirt of the appellant and\\nthe blood stained grey coat of the deceased for chemical\\nexamination to the Forensic Science Laboratory and had received\\na report on 25.11.2003. During the course of investigation, P.W.3\\nexamined P.Ws.1, 2, 4 and 5 and obtained their statements. After\\ncompletion of the investigation, P.W.3 laid charge sheet against\\nthe appellant under Section 302 IPC.\\n6. After completing the formalities, the case was\\ncommitted to the file of Sessions Court. Since the appellant had\\nno means to engage a lawyer to defend herself, the trial Court\\nappointed Amicus Curiae.\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 5\\n7. Before the trial Court, on the side of the prosecution,\\n5 witnesses were examined and marked 16 documents. Accused\\nwas questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C. about the incriminating\\nevidence and circumstances. In most of the questions, the\\nappellant has stated “no answer”. The appellant has not examined\\nany witness on her side.\\n8. Upon consideration of the oral and documentary\\nevidence, the Learned Sessions Judge, Manipur West, by the\\njudgment dated 14.6.2010 convicted the appellant under Section\\n302 IPC and posted the case on 16.6.2010 for hearing on\\nsentence. On 16.6.2010, after hearing the appellant as well as the\\nprosecution, the Learned Sessions Judge sentenced the appellant\\nto undergo life imprisonment.\\n9. Assailing the judgment of the Sessions Judge, the\\nlearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial Court\\nmis-appreciated both facts and law of the case in passing the\\nimpugned judgment and had also failed to see that the chain of\\ncircumstances in the case as disclosed by the prosecution was not\\ncompleted. She would submit that there was no eye witness to the\\nalleged occurrence and as such the trial Court ought to have\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 6\\nappreciated the available circumstantial evidences properly\\nwithout its own presumption and summaries.\\n10. The learned counsel further submitted that the\\nprosecution has failed to prove the motive, knowledge and\\nintention of the appellant to kill the deceased. She would submit\\nthat the prosecution did not show the weapon alleged to have\\nbeen used for the crime to P.W.1-Doctor for obtaining his opinion\\nabout the possibility of causing the nature of injuries by the same\\nweapon thereby missing the link between the injury and the seized\\nweapon of the crime. She would further submit that the trial Court\\nmainly relied upon the evidence of P.W.5, which is not\\ncorroborated by any other witnesses. Arguing so, the learned\\ncounsel for the appellant prayed for setting aside the judgment of\\nthe trial Court.\\n11. Per contra, reiterating the findings recorded by the\\ntrial Court, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that upon\\nappreciating the oral and documentary evidence produced by the\\nprosecution, the trial Court has rightly convicted the accused and\\nsentenced her to undergo life imprisonment; He would submit that\\nsince own daughter killed her father, no leniency could be shown\\nto the appellant. In fact, the evidences of P.Ws.1 to 5 makes chain\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 7\\nto the prosecution version and thus, prayed for dismissal of the\\nappeal.\\n12. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant as well\\nas the learned Public Prosecutor and also perused the materials\\navailable on record.\\n13. The point that arises for consideration is whether the\\ntrial Court was right in convicting the appellant/accused for the\\noffence under Section 302 IPC for causing death to the deceased\\nKhosole Poumai, who is the father of the appellant.\\n14. It appears that P.W.5 is the son of the deceased and\\nbrother of the appellant/accused, whose evidence is very much\\nvital to the case of the prosecution. In his evidence, P.W.5 stated\\nthat on 16.4.2003 at around 12 noon, he was working in the\\nkitchen garden and at that time he heard some noise sound of\\nargument between his deceased father and his younger sister, the\\nappellant herein. As it was a normal practice, he did not take it\\nseriously and after some time, he heard loud sound of beating\\ninside the room. On hearing the loud sound of beating,\\nimmediately, he was running towards the room of his father.\\nBefore reaching the room of his father, he saw the appellant\\nrunning out of the room of his father and went towards the jungle\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 8\\nside. When P.W.5 stopped her, she was not responding.\\nThereafter, P.W.5 rushed inside the room of his father, where he\\nfound his father was lying death beside his bed with bleeding\\ninjury on the back side of his head. At the spot, P.w.5 had also\\nfound one wooden handle of axe near the dead body of his father.\\nOn seeing the dead body, he said that his younger sister, the\\nappellant herein, had committed murder of his father. Thereafter,\\nP.W.5 informed the same to his neighbours, Chairman and\\nSecretary of the Village viz., L.Dale and Stephen to report the\\nmatter to the police for taking necessary legal action.\\n15. The evidence of P.W.5 has been corroborated by the\\nevidence of P.W.2, who had lodged the complaint. In his evidence,\\nP.W.2 deposed that he knew the appellant and during the year\\n2003, he was serving as Chairman of Taphou Phoimei Village. On\\n16.4.2003, at about 12.30 P.M., while he was staying his home,\\nthe elder brother of the appellant viz., Soloni (P.W.5) reached at\\nhis home and informed him that the appellant/accused killed her\\nown father by holding an axe at her own residence. After that he\\nalong with P.W.5 rushed to the occurrence place, where he found\\nthe deceased lying dead in a full of blood and he had also seen\\nthe axe used in the said crime on the spot, but the appellant was\\nnot present at that time.\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 9\\n16. In his evidence, P.W.2 further deposed that on the\\nsame day at about 1.30 P.M., he along with the Village Secretary\\nviz., Stephen (P.W.4) went to the Senapati Police Station and\\nlodged a written report against the appellant/accused. P.W.2\\nspecifically deposed that he himself written the complaint and he\\nhad also identified his signature found in the complaint. The\\nevidence of P.W.2 is also to the effect that with the help of\\nvillagers, they had conducted intensive search to locate the\\nappellant and finally, 0n 18.4.2003, they found the appellant hiding\\nin the nearby jungle and captured her.\\n17. In his evidence, P.W.4 deposed that on 16.4.2003\\nwhile he was .staying in his house, he heard a sound of woman\\nsaying that one person was killed. On hearing the said sound, he\\nwas running towards the residence of Khosole, where he found\\nthat Khosole was lying death in his bed room with bleeding injuries\\non the back side of the head. P.W.4 had also seen one axe with\\nwooden handle lying near the dead body and the axe was stained\\nwith blood. At the relevant time, P.W.2-Village Chairman and son\\nof the deceased viz., P.W.5 were also present at the spot.\\nThereafter, all of them went to the Police Station, where P.W.2\\nhad lodged the complaint.\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 10\\n18. From the evidence of P.W.5, it is clear that after\\nhearing the sound when he was running to his father’s bed room,\\nhe saw the appellant coming out of the room and when he\\nstopped her, the appellant did not respond and ran away towards\\nthe jungle. To disprove the said version of P.w.5, the appellant has\\nnot produced any evidence. On the other hand, during cross-\\nexamination of P.W.5, a question was posed to the effect that “did\\nyou see how his father was killed”, for which, the answer of P.W.5\\nis, it is not true that he did not exactly see how his father Khosole\\nwas killed as he was working at his kitchen garden. Though P.W.5\\nhas not directly seen the killing of the deceased by the appellant\\nby using axe, after hearing the sound when P.W.5 was running to\\nthe bed room of his father, he saw the appellant running out of the\\nbed room. The said evidence of P.W.5 would prove that appellant\\nalone was responsible for the cause of death.\\n19. Since the deceased was proved to have been last\\nseen alive when the appellant was quarrelling with him in the bed\\nroom of the deceased father, which facts was stated by P.W.5, it is\\nfor the appellant to satisfactorily explain as to what happened to\\ndeceased. Observing that if person who was last found in the\\ncompany of another and if later found missing or dead, then the\\nperson with whom he was last found has to explain the\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 11\\ncircumstances in which they parted company, in State of\\nRajasthan v. Kashi Ram, reported in (2007) 2 MLJ (Crl) 861 (SC),\\nthe Hon\\'ble Supreme Court held as follows:\\n“22. ..... Thus, if a person is last seen with the\\ndeceased, he must offer an explanation as to how\\nand when he parted company. He must furnish an\\nexplanation which appears to the Court to be\\nprobable and satisfactory. If he does so he must\\nbe held to have discharged his burden. If he fails\\nto offer an explanation on the basis of facts within\\nhis special knowledge, he failed to discharge the\\nburden cast upon him by Section 106 of Evidence\\nAct. In a case resting on circumstantial evidence if\\nthe accused fails to offer a reasonable\\nexplanation in discharge of the burden placed on\\nhim, that itself provides an additional link in the\\nchain\\' of circumstances proved against him.\\nSection 106 does not shift the burden of proof in a\\ncriminal trial, which is always upon the\\nprosecution. It lays down the rule that when the\\naccused does not throw any light upon facts\\nwhich are specially within his knowledge and\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 12\\nwhich could not support any theory or hypothesis\\ncompatible with his innocence, the Court can\\nconsider his failure to adduce any explanation, as\\nan additional link which completes the chain. The\\nprinciple has been succinctly stated in Re. Naina\\nMohd. AIR 1960 Madras 218.”\\n20. There is considerable force in the argument of\\ncounsel for the respondent State that in the facts of this case as\\nwell it should be held that the appellant having been seen last with\\nthe deceased, the burden was upon her to prove what happened\\nthereafter, since those facts were within her special knowledge.\\nThough the learned counsel for the appellant contended that at\\nthe time of alleged occurrence, the appellant was unsound mind,\\nnothing has been produced to establish that she was in unsound\\nmind on the date of occurrence and therefore, the argument of the\\nlearned counsel for the appellant that on the date of occurrence,\\nthe appellant was in unsound mind, cannot be countenanced.\\n21. The case of the prosecution mainly hinges upon the\\ncircumstantial evidence. It is well settled principle of law that in\\ncases where the evidence is purely circumstantial in nature, the\\nfacts, the circumstances from which the conclusion of the guilt is\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 13\\nsought to be drawn must be fully established beyond any\\nreasonable doubt and such circumstances must be consistent and\\nunerringly point to the guilt of the accused and the chain of\\ncircumstances must be established by the prosecution.\\n22. In the instant case, as rightly observed by the trial\\nCourt it is clear that P.W.5, who is the resident of the same\\ncompound with the appellant and the deceased, as disclosed by\\nthe oral evidence and supported by rough sketch, heard\\nquarrelling sound between the deceased and appellant residing in\\nthe same house as usual and after some time, he heard a loud\\nsound of beating which attracted him towards the room of the\\ndeceased and just when P.W.5 is to reach to the room of the\\ndeceased, the appellant rushed out and ran away paying no heed\\nto his request to stop and thereafter, the appellant disappeared.\\nOn the third day of the occurrence, the appellant was arrested\\nfrom the nearby jungle by the police with the help of villagers. This\\nconduct of the appellant is also accountable in finding out the\\nmaterials as to the commission of the offence.\\n23. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the appellant\\npointed out that the appellant is of unsound mind at the relevant\\npoint of time and the appellant has not caused the death of her\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 14\\nfather. The fact remains that no question and/or questions were\\nput to the witnesses in respect of the unsound mind of the\\nappellant. In other words, it appears that the defence admitted the\\nstatement of the prosecution witnesses. The only plea of the\\ndefence is that the appellant is of unsound mind and the said plea\\nof unsound mind has not been proved by way of medical\\nevidence.\\n24. In the course of proceeding of hearing, there is no a\\nsingle instance which warranted by the behavior of the appellant\\nto cause examination through a Psychiatrist. Further, the appellant\\nwas produced in most of the dates of hearing before the Court and\\nthere was no complaint of unsound mind.\\n25. It is settled that when a case rests upon\\ncircumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy the following\\ntests:\\n(a) the circumstances from which an inference\\nof guilt is sought to be drawn, must be\\ncogently and firmly established;\\n(b) those circumstances should be of a definite\\ntendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of\\nthe accused;\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 15\\n(c) the circumstances, taken cumulatively,\\nshould form a chain so complete that there is\\nno escape from the conclusion that within all\\nhuman probability the crime was committed by\\nthe accused and non else; and\\n(d) the circumstantial evidence in order to\\nsustain conviction must be complete and\\nincapable of explanation of any other\\nhypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused\\nand such evidence should not only be\\nconsisting with the guilt of the accused but\\nshould be inconsistent with his innocence.\\n26. Admittedly, there is no eye-witness to the\\noccurrence. However, the circumstances stated are strong enough\\nand made out an unbreakable chain which inferred the\\ncommission of the offence of murder of the deceased.\\n27. As to what would be reasonable doubt has been laid\\ndown by the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.Gopal Reddy\\nv. State of AR, reported in (1979) 1 SCC 355. In K.Gopal Reddy\\n(supra), the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court held that it stems out of the\\nfundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 16\\naccused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. If two\\nreasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence\\nare possible, one must necessarily concede the existence of a\\nreasonable doubt. But, fanciful and remote possibilities must be\\nleft out of account. To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a\\ndoubt arising from the possibility of a duality of views, the possible\\nview in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably\\nprobable as that against him. If the preponderance of probability is\\nall one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the\\naccused to claim the benefit of any doubt. It is, therefore, essential\\nthat any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be\\nreasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused\\nperson may claim, must be reasonable. “A reasonable doubt”, it\\nhas been remarked, “does not mean some light, airy, insubstantial\\ndoubt that may flit through the minds of any of us about almost\\nanything at some time or other it does not mean a doubt begotten\\nby sympathy out of reluctance to convict it means a real doubt, a\\ndoubt founded upon reason.\\n28. In the instant case, the prosecution has established\\nthe circumstances and as such all the links in the chain of\\ncircumstances is so complete pointing to the guilt of the appellant.\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 17\\nThus, the circumstances originating the guilt are proved beyond\\nreasonable doubt.\\n29. Coming to the seizure of the grey coat having blood\\nstain and the wooden axe handle by P.W.3-Investigating Officer\\nunder Ex.P3, the evidences of P.W.2 and 4 supports the\\nprosecution version. Moreover, the examination of seizure\\nwitnesses and seizure of material objects have not been disputed\\nby the appellant.’ That apart, the seizure of light blue and white\\ncolour silk shirt having blood stain by P.W.3 under Ex.P5 on\\n18.04.2003 has also not been disputed by the appellant.\\n30. P.W.3 sent the seized blood stained coat and blood\\nstained shirt to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Pangei for\\nexamination and the Expert has given his report that the stains\\nfound are human blood group AB. At this juncture, it is to be\\nmentioned that from the side of the appellant it is silent regarding\\nother probabilities of the blood stain on the shirt of the appellant\\nother than that of the deceased and the failure to explain from the\\nside of the appellant how the deceased died in the circumstances\\nof the case, further lead inference of commission of the crime by\\nthe appellant/accused.\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 18\\n31. As rightly held by the trial Court, the circumstances in\\nthe case infer the probability of human blood of same group AB\\nfrom same source i.e. the coat worn by the deceased and the shirt\\nworn by the appellant, is that of the deceased. It may be\\nmentioned that the prosecution witnesses deposed that the\\ndeceased was lying in a pool of blood from his injuries.\\n32. The arrest of the appellant and her confessional\\nstatement followed with the seizure have not been seriously\\ndisputed by the appellant/accused. Ex.P4 is the disclosure\\nstatement given by the appellant/accused and pursuant to the\\nsame, one light blue and while colour silk shirt having blood\\nstained of the appellant was seized. The disclosure statement and\\nthe recovery are strong circumstance connecting the appellant\\nwith the offence.\\n33. As stated supra, the seized articles were sent to the\\nForensic Science Laboratory and the Expert report reveals that\\nthe stains found on the exhibits marked “A” and “B\" are human\\nblood of blood group AB. The aforesaid report of the Expert also is\\na strong circumstance connecting the appellant with the crime.\\n34. The circumstances of the case as disclosed by the\\nwitnesses never show probability of any other person coming to\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 19\\nthe place of occurrence at the relevant point of time. There was no\\nother person except the appellant who had entered the room of\\nthe deceased. The said plea of the prosecution was supported by\\nthe evidence of P.W.5. Moreover, the narration of P.W.5, who is\\nthe elder brother of the appellant, has never been denied by the\\nappellant by letting in evidence. There is no reason to falsely\\nimplicate the appellant by her own brother P.W.5. The heavy\\nsound as stated by P.W.5 is also supported by the evidence of\\nP.W.4.\\n35. Taking us through the evidence of PWs 1, 2 and 5,\\nlearned counsel for appellant contended that there are several\\ncontradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence of those\\nwitnesses which would vitally affect the prosecution. She argued\\nthat when evidence of witnesses is beset with contradictions, the\\nCourt may not rely upon such evidences.\\n36. Not all discrepancy in the testimony of a witness are\\nfatal to the case of the prosecution. In State of Rajasthan v. Smt.\\nKalki, reported in (1981) 2 SCC 752, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court\\nheld:\\n“8. In the depositions of witnesses there are\\nalways normal discrepancies however honest and\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 20\\ntruthful they may be. These discrepancies are due\\nto normal errors of observation, normal errors of\\nmemory due to lapse of time, due to mental\\ndisposition such as shock and horror at the time\\nof the occurrence, and the like. Material\\ndiscrepancies are those which are not normal,\\nand not expected of a normal person....”\\n37. The main thing to be seen is, whether such\\ninconsistencies relating to the appellant would go to root of the\\nmatter. Despite cross-examination, nothing worth was elicited\\nshaking the credibility of PWs 1, 2, 4 and 5. The Court should not\\ndisbelieve the evidence of PWs 1, 2, 4 and 5 altogether as their\\nevidence is trustworthy in respect of the overt act of the appellant.\\nIn our considered view, such discrepancy regarding presence of\\nthe appellant would not vitally affect the consistent version PWs 1,\\n2, 4 and 5, more particularly, P.w.5 as to the overt act of the\\nappellant.\\n38. Evidence of PWs 1, 2, 4 and 5 stands amply\\ncorroborated by the objective findings by Investigating Officer\\nabout the scene of occurrence, detection of human blood in the\\nblood stained clothes seized from the scene of occurrence and the\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 21\\ndetection of human blood in the seized material objects which\\nlends assurance to the prosecution version of the guilt of the\\naccused/appellant.\\n39. Coming to Ex.P1-post-mortem report, the same has\\nnot been disputed and/or denied by the appellant. In fact, P.W.1-\\nDoctor who had conducted the autopsy had noted the aforesaid\\ninternal and external presences and after completion of the\\nautopsy given his opinion to the following effect:\\n“After completion of the post-mortem I have my\\nopinion as to the cause of death as of Homicidal\\nin nature and the time since death was\\napproximately 6 hrs and the nature of injuries was\\nof anti-mortem and age of the injury was 5 hours.\\nAfter filling up the details of the post mortem\\nreport with my own hand writing, I pout my\\nsignature in the said post mortem report and\\nthereafter, I submitted the post mortem report to\\nthe Chief Medical Officer, Senapati District\\nHospital for further necessary action. The age and\\naddress of the dead body was 85 years and\\nTapohou Phlyamai village, Senapati District. ”\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 22\\n40. From Ex.P1-post-mortem report, it can be inferred\\nwithout any doubt that it was the appellant/accused and none else\\nwho had murdered her own father, the deceased herein.\\n41. As rightly said by the trial Court everybody will be\\nshocked to hear such an incident of killing of an aged father by her\\nown daughter. The materials produced as also the other evidence\\nadduced by the prosecution would prove that before the\\noccurrence, there was a quarrel between the appellant and the\\ndeceased and that the appellant committed murder of her own\\nfather. It is to be mentioned that at the age of 85 years where the\\nservice and assistance of children and near ones are required for\\nsurvival of the rest of the life, without thinking that much, the\\nappellant has killed the deceased. In such circumstances, for the\\noffence committed by the appellant, the sentence as imprisonment\\nis justified.\\n42. Upon analysis of the evidence, we are of the view\\nthat the prosecution has succeeded in proving its case.\\nAccordingly, the prosecution has proved the circumstances\\ncumulatively in the form of a complete chain of events unerringly\\npointing the guilt on the appellant. Upon evaluation of the\\nevidence, the trial Court has rightly convicted the appellant for the\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017P age | 23\\noffence under Section 302 IPC and we find no error in the\\njudgment of the trial Court. We find no valid grounds to interfere\\nwith the judgment of the trial Court as well as the sentence\\nimposed.\\n43. In the result, the appeal is dismissed.\\nJUDGE CHIEF JUSTICE\\nFR/NFR\\nSushil\\nCril. Appeal No. 2 of 2017',\n",

Misc. Case No.14 of 2017 arising out of the Original\\n(Probate) Suit No. 22/2000/3 of 2016 by which the application for\\namendment of the written statement was dismissed by it.\\n[3.1] Fact and circumstances which have led to the filing of the instant\\nCivil Revision Petition, are that on 04-04-1997, the principal respondent\\nfiled an Original (Probate) Suit No.22 of 2000 praying for grant of probate\\nin respect of a Will executed by his late father, the testator. The petitioner\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[3]\\nfiled his written statement raising various issues including the issue relating\\nto the maintainability of the Will on the ground that certain properties which\\ndo not belong to the testator, have been included in the Will. Three issues\\nwere framed in the suit, of which one was as to whether the “Will” was a\\nlegally valid Will or not. The District & Sessions Judge, having found that\\nthe Will was executed by the testator on 04-04-1997, allowed and decreed\\nthe suit vide its judgment and order dated 24-05-2004 granting probate in\\nfavour of the principal respondent. Being aggrieved by the judgment and\\norder of the learned District & Sessions Judge, the petitioner preferred an\\nappeal being FAO No.4 of 2004 before the Hon’ble Gauhati High Court,\\nImphal Bench. Hardly a year later, the proforma respondent also preferred\\nan appeal being FAO No.5 of 2005 against the same judgment and order.\\nWhile the FAO No.4 of 2004 was pending, the petitioner filed an\\napplication being Misc. Case (FAO) No.4 of 2014 under Order VI Rule 17\\nof the CPC read with Section 268 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 for\\namendment of his written statement.\\n[3.2] Both the FAOs were considered together and during the course\\nof hearing, it was submitted by the counsel appearing for the petitioner that\\nthe testator was 96 years old at the time of executing the Will; that he was\\nincapable of independently writing a Will, since he was suffering from\\nchronic cerebral blood flow insufficiency, ishchaemic heart disease and\\nthat he was mostly bed ridden. His hands were also shaking and under\\nsuch mental and physical condition, he could not have written the Will\\nhimself. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the principal\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[4]\\nrespondent No.1, relying upon the findings of the learned District &\\nSessions Judge and also the evidences of PWs, contended that the\\ntestator was both physically and mentally fit to write the Will in his own\\nhands. After having heard the counsel appearing for the parties and relying\\nupon the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Joyce\\nPrimrose Prestor (Mrs.)(NEE VAS) Vs. Vera Marie Vas (Ms) & ors.,\\n(1996) 9 SCC 324 which was followed by the Gauhati High Court in the\\ncase of Dipty Chkraborty Vs. Santosh Kr. Chakraborty, 2001(1) GLT\\n360, this Court agreed with the view taken by the District & Sessions\\nJudge that the testator was in a fit mental and physical condition to write\\nthe Will in his own hands; that he was aware of what was he doing and\\nthat the Will was also attested by two witnesses in support of the execution\\nthereof.\\n[3.3] This Court, after having observed as hereinabove, considered a\\npoint raised by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner as well as\\nthe proforma respondent No.2 that at the time of execution of the Will, the\\ntestator was not the owner of certain properties mentioned in the Will and\\ntherefore, he could not have bequeathed those properties in favour of the\\nbeneficiaries mentioned therein. In order to substantiate his contention, a\\nreliance was placed by him on a decree passed by the Musif, Imphal in\\nO.S No.2 of 1986 which was filed by the testator himself against the\\npetitioner and some other family members for declaration that the suit land\\ndescribed in Schedule “C” of the plaint was a part and parcel of 1/6 share\\nof the testator and a prayer for eviction was made therein. The suit was\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[5]\\ndecreed in favour of the testator. On the basis of various documents which\\nformed part of the said suit, it was contended by learned counsel\\nappearing for the petitioner that some of the properties bequeathed under\\nthe Will, did not belong to the testator and therefore, no such Will could be\\nexecuted in respect of those properties. Refuting the said contentions, the\\nlearned counsel appearing for the principal respondent submitted that the\\nlearned District & Sessions Judge while dealing with an application for\\ngrant of probate, was only required to see whether the Will was executed\\nproperly or not and was not required to see the title over the property. The\\nlearned counsel appearing for the principal respondent relied upon a\\ndecision of the Patna High Court in Kamleshwari Devi (Deceased) and\\nVikash Singh & ors. Vs. Devesh Pratap Singh, AIR 2002 PATNA 24.\\nThe same view was also expressed by the learned Single Judge of the\\nGauhati High Court in Durlabh Chandra Bhattacharjee Vs. Atul\\nBharthkaur, 2005 (4) GLT 306 and Guneshwar Chutia Vs. Haren Chutia\\n& ors., AIR 1974 GAU 73 (V 61 C 25).\\n[3.4] On the strength of the decision rendered by the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court in Ghulam Qadir Vs. Special Tribunal & ors., (2002) 1\\nSupreme Court Cases 33, this court did not agree with the submission of\\nthe learned counsel appearing for the principal respondent. This court took\\nthe view that in the present case, the learned District & Sessions Judge did\\nnot decide the said objection raised by the petitioner solely on the ground\\nthat it had no jurisdiction to enter into the question of title. Prima facie\\nwhen it appears to the Court that certain properties have been bequeathed\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[6]\\nunder a Will of which the testator was not the owner, it is the duty of the\\nCourt also to examine such objection. Accordingly, the matter was remitted\\nback to the learned District & Sessions Judge, Imphal West for\\nreconsideration in accordance with law. While confirming the findings of\\nthe learned District & Sessions Judge that the Will was executed by the\\ntestator in accordance with law, this court remitted the matter back to the\\nlearned District & Sessions Judge for the purpose of examining the\\nobjection raised by the petitioner and the proforma respondent with regard\\nto the title of the testator over certain properties bequeathed under the Will\\nin terms of the judgment of the Apex Court in Ghulam Qadir Vs. Special\\nTribunal & ors. (supra).\\n[3.5] After the matter having been remitted to the District & Sessions\\nJudge, the petitioner filed an application being Judl. Misc. Case No.14 of\\n2017 praying for amendment of his written statement. This application was\\ncontested by the counsel appearing for the principal respondent on the\\nground that as there was no explanation for the delay, it was not\\nmaintainable and moreover, it was filed based on the similar application\\nfiled before this Court. In his reply, the learned counsel appearing for the\\npetitioner submitted that the application filed before the High Court, while\\nthe FAOs were pending, would be deemed to have been allowed, when\\nthe FAOs were disposed of by remitting the same to the learned District &\\nSessions Judge for consideration of the objection raised by the petitioner\\nas regards the properties being bequeathed under the Will. Considering\\nthe submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the parties, the\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[7]\\nlearned District & Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that in the\\njudgment and order dated 19-01-2015 of this Court, nothing was\\nmentioned about the application being allowed and therefore, it would be\\npresumed that this Court did not allow the amendment application. The\\nlearned District & Sessions Judge further held that it is nowhere mentioned\\nin the application that the petitioner could not raise the matter before the\\ncommencement of the trial in spite of his due diligence.\\n[4] Being aggrieved by the order dated 21-06-2017, the instant\\nrevision petition has been filed questioning the validity and correctness of it\\non the inter-alia grounds that the learned District & Sessions Judge failed\\nto appreciate the judgment and order dated 19-01-2015 of this court by\\nwhich the matter was remitted to it for reconsideration; that the learned\\nDistrict & Sessions Judge failed to apply its mind and that there were\\ndiscoveries of new facts and evidences which could not be pleaded in the\\nwritten statement and are required for determining the real controversies\\nbetween the parties.\\n[5] It is not in dispute that the application for amendment of the\\nwritten statement was rejected by the learned District & Sessions Judge\\nmainly on two grounds-one, it will be presumed that this court did not allow\\nthe application for amendment of the written statement and two, as\\nprovided under Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC, the petitioner did not mention\\nanything in the application that he could not raise the matter before the\\ncommencement of the trial in spite of due diligence. As regards the first\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[8]\\nground, it may be noted that an application for amendment of the written\\nstatement was filed before this court and this court, while disposing of the\\nFAOs and remitting the matter back to the learned District & Sessions\\nJudge for reconsideration of the issue as to whether the testator was the\\nowner in respect of all the properties bequeathed under the Will vide its\\njudgment and order dated 19-01-2015, did not say anything about the\\napplication. As a matter of fact, this court ought to have passed an order\\neither rejecting or allowing or disposing it of but inadvertently, it had not\\nbeen done so. But the facts remains that the FAOs had been disposed of\\nby this court, remitting the matter back to the learned District & Sessions\\nJudge, with no order being passed by this court in respect of the\\napplication. It is well known that once a main matter has been disposed of\\nby the court, any application filed therein cannot stand on its own feet and\\nit ought to go along with the main matter. In the present case, after the\\nFAOs being disposed of by this court, it cannot be presumed that the\\napplication has either been allowed or rejected in the absence of any\\nspecific order being passed by this court in that regard. At the most, it can\\nbe said that it may have been disposed of with the main matter. Keeping in\\nmind the peculiar circumstances of the case, this court is of the view that\\nthere is nothing wrong when an application was filed by the petitioner\\nbefore the learned District & Sessions Judge for amendment of the writ\\nstatement. The learned District & Sessions Judge has committed an error\\nwhile rejecting it on this ground without going into its merit.\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[9]\\n[6] As regards the second ground, it relates to the interpretation of\\nOrder 6 Rule 17 of the CPC which reads as under:\\n“17. Amendment of pleadings- The Court may at any stage of the\\nproceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings\\nin such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such\\namendments shall be made as may be necessary for the\\npurpose of determining the real questions in controversy\\nbetween the parties:\\nProvided that no application for amendment shall be allowed\\nafter the trial has commenced, unless the Court comes to the\\nconclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party could not\\nhave raised the matter before the commencement of trial.”\\nThis Order 6 Rule 17 deals with the amendment of pleadings and\\nan amendment can be allowed provided two conditions are fulfilled-one, it\\nshall not cause injustice to the other side and two, it is necessary for the\\npurpose of determining the real question in controversy between the\\nparties. At the time of considering the application for amendment, the court\\nhas only to look as to whether the conditions mentioned above are fulfilled\\nor not. Moreover, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in a catena of decisions has\\nlaid down the law that the courts while deciding such application should not\\ntake a hypertechnical view. The jurisdiction of the court either to allow or\\nnot to allow amendment is discretionary and therefore, it shall be exercised\\nin a judicious evaluation of facts and circumstances in which the\\namendments are sought for. This order 6 Rule 17 was, at one time,\\ndeleted but was restored by the amendment Act, 22 of 2002 but with an\\nadded proviso which curtails the absolute discretion. As per this proviso to\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[10]\\nOrder 6 Rule 17 of the CPC, after the commencement of the trial, such\\namendment cannot normally be allowed except on the conclusion being\\narrived at by the Court that in spite of due diligence, the party could not\\nhave raised the matter before the commencement of the trial. But with\\nrespect to the application of the proviso, the Hon’ble Supreme Court made\\nthe position clear in State Bank of Hyderabad Vs. Town Municipal\\nCouncil, (2007) 1 SCC 765 wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed\\nthat the proviso was added by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment)\\nAct, 2002 which came into force with effect from 01-07-2002 and that this\\nproviso would not apply to the suit having been filed in the year, 1998. In\\nthe present case also, the suit was filed in the year, 1997, although it was\\nregistered as Judl. Misc. Case No. 22 of 2000. In terms of the decision\\nrendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in State Bank of Hyderabad case\\n(supra), the proviso will have no application at all to the facts and\\ncircumstances of the present case and the application for amendment of\\nthe written statement ought to have been considered by the learned\\nDistrict & Sessions Judge as per Order 6 Rule 17 as to whether the\\ningredients thereof are satisfied. Since the learned District & Sessions\\nJudge has failed to do that, its order dated 21-06-2017 has been rendered\\nbad in law and is liable to be quashed and set aside.\\n[7] In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the\\ninstant civil revision petition is allowed and consequently, the order dated\\n21-06-2017, impugned herein, is quashed and set aside with the direction\\nthat the learned District & Sessions Judge, Imphal West shall consider and\\nCRP (CRP ART. 227) No. 25 of 2017 Contd…/-[11]\\ndecide the application being Judl.

Although the petitioner had performed\\nvery well, he was not appointed at all.\\n[3.4] Being suspicious about the selection process being undertaken\\nby the respondents, the petitioner consulted one of his counsel who filed\\nan application under the RTI Act for obtaining certain information from\\nthe respondent No.2 who furnished it vide letter dated 11-01-2017 along\\nwith copies of the documents submitted by the candidates. On perusal\\nof the said documents, the petitioner came to know that the respondent\\nNos.3 and 5 who are listed at Sl. No.1 and 3 of the appointment order\\ndated 03-12-2016, did not possess the requisite Cinematograph\\nOperator Licence on or before the last date for submission of the\\napplication form and even on the date of written test and viva-voce. The\\nsaid Cinematograph Operator Licenses produced by the respondent\\nNos. 3 and 5 indicate the dates of their issuance as 04-11-2016 and 13-\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[5]\\n10-2016 respectively when the last date for submission of the\\napplication form was 10-10-2016 and therefore, the respondent Nos.3\\nand 5 were not eligible for appointment to the post of Assistant Cinema\\nOperators as they did not possess the requisite qualifications on or\\nbefore the last date for submission of the application form. Pursuant to\\nanother application dated 10-12-2016, filed under the RTI Act, the\\nrespondent No.2 furnished information vide its letter dated 06-04-2017\\nenclosing therewith the copies of the recruitment rules for the post of\\nAssistant Cinema Operator.\\n[3.5] Being aggrieved by the appointment order dated 03-12-2016,\\nthe instant writ petition has been filed by the petitioner on the inter-alia\\ngrounds that since the respondent Nos. 3 and 5 were not eligible on the\\nlast date for submission of the application form, their candidatures ought\\nto have been rejected; that the petitioner was deprived of what he\\nrightfully deserved and was penalized it for no fault of his; that the action\\nof the respondents is unreasonable and arbitrary being violative of\\nArticle 14 of the Constitution of India.\\n[4] In the affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf of the respondent\\nNo.2, the averments made in the writ petition were denied and in\\naddition thereto, it has been specifically denied that the petitioner\\nperformed well in the common written test as well as viva-voce. From\\nthe statement of the marks secured by the candidates in the written test\\nand viva-voce for recruitment to the post of Assistant Cinema Operator,\\nthe petitioner secured less mark than that of the respondent Nos.3 and\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[6]\\n4. As regards the respondent No. 3, he possessed a Cinematograph\\nOperator Licence issued on 16-12-2013 and although the said licence\\nwas valid for three years, a new licence was issued on 04-11-2016 prior\\nto the expiry of the earlier licence. Both the copies of the licenses are in\\nthe file of the Department. So far as the respondent No.5 is concerned,\\nhe submitted a provisional Cinema Operator Licence dated 10-10-2016\\ndue to non-availability of Licence Card along with the application form\\nobtained on 13-10-2016 and he was allowed to appear in the DPC on\\nthe basis of the application filed by him. An affidavit-in-opposition on\\nbehalf of the respondent Nos.3 and 5 also has been filed wherein it has\\nbeen stated that the petitioner has no locus standi to challenge the\\nappointment of the private respondent No. 5 who is appointed under the\\nST category. Rest of the affidavit are similar to that of the averments\\nmade in the affidavit of respondent No. 2 and therefore, the same are\\nnot repeated here for the sake of brevity.\\n[5] In his rejoinder affidavit, the petitioner has stated that the\\nrespondent No.3, while submitting his application dated 17-10-2016, did\\nnot mention about the possession of the earlier licence and had he\\npossessed the licence, he should have mentioned it in the application\\nthat he would apply for the renewal of his earlier licence instead of\\napplying for a fresh licence. Similarly, the respondent No.5 submitted his\\napplication dated 06-10-2016 for obtaining a Cinematograph Operator\\nLicence stating that he had undergone three years course training as\\nAssistant Cinema Operator under the Firm Asha Cinema, Paona Bazar\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[7]\\nfrom February 2008 till 2011. After the erstwhile Electricity Department,\\nGovernment of Manipur having been unbundled into two State owned\\ncompanies, the existence of documents namely the certificate dated 20-\\n10-2016 and the Cinematograph Operator Licence dated 04-11-2016\\nsigned by Shri S. Singhajit Singh, Electrical Inspector, Electricity\\nDepartment, Government of Manipur, was not possible at all. As regards\\nrespondent No.5, the fact that the respondent No.2 did not furnish a\\ncopy of the provisional Cinema Licence dated 10-10-2016, in reply to\\nthe RTI application, shows that the said document was not in his\\ncustody at the time of furnishing the information. Moreover, under the\\nManipur Cinematograph Rules, 1955, there is no provision for issuance\\nof a provisional Cinematograph Operator Licence with the result that the\\nsaid provisional Licence dated 10-10-2016 would have been non-est.\\nAfter the rejoinder affidavit having been filed by the petitioner, the\\nrespondent No.3 filed an additional affidavit stating that the petitioner did\\nnot possess a valid Cinematograph Operator Licence at the time of\\nsubmission of his application form on 13-01-2015. Along with the\\napplication form, the petitioner submitted a certificate which was issued\\non 06-09-1995 having validity of three years, from which it is seen that\\nthe fee of the certificate was deposited at the Imphal treasury vide\\nchallan dated 05-11-2008 which would have expired in the year, 2011.\\nMoreover, the certificate having full of irregularity apart from the expiry\\nof its validity, cannot be considered to be a valid certificate for the\\npurpose of appointment to the post of Assistant Cinema Operator and\\ntherefore, the application of the petitioner ought to have been rejected\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[8]\\ndue to lack of requisite qualifications or valid licence. In the reply\\naffidavit filed by the petitioner, it has been stated that since the original\\ncertificate issued in the year 1995 being old and torn, the petitioner\\nasked for issuing a duplicate certificate which was issued in the year\\n2008. It has been further stated that the certificate was renewed from\\ntime to time as indicated in the certificate itself which is a genuine one.\\n[6] From the aforesaid pleadings, the following issues fell for\\nconsideration by this court:\\n(a) Whether the respondent Nos.3 & 5 and the petitioner were\\nholding valid Cinematograph Operator Licenses on the last\\ndate for submission of application forms ?\\n(b) Whether the petitioner has any locus standi to question the\\nprocess of selection after the same having been completed\\nand in particular, the appointment order dated 03-12-2016\\nhaving been issued thereafter ?\\n[7] It has been submitted by Shri Th. Khagemba, the learned\\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner that the petitioner was holding a\\nvalid Cinematograph Operator Licence on the last date for submission\\nof application form but the respondent Nos.3 & 5 did not have such\\nlicense and therefore, their candidatures ought to have been rejected by\\nthe State Government. The act of the State respondent appointing the\\nrespondent Nos.3 & 5 as the Assistant Cinema Operators is highly\\nunreasonable and illegal. In support of his contention, reliance has been\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[9]\\nplaced on the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\\nAshok Kumar Shonkar Vs. Union of India, (2007) 4 SCC 54, wherein\\nthe Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the view taken by it in Ashok\\nKumar Sharma Vs. Chander Shekhar, (1997) 4 SCC 18 was the\\nauthority wherein it was held that the proposition that where applications\\nare called for, prescribing a particular date as the last date for filing the\\napplications, the eligibility of the candidates shall have to be judged with\\nreference to that date and that date alone, is a well established one. A\\nperson who acquires the prescribed qualification subsequent to such\\nprescribed date cannot be considered at all. An advertisement/\\nnotification issued/ published calling for applications constitutes a\\nrepresentation to the public and the authority issuing it is bound by such\\nrepresentation. It cannot act contrary to it. Similar view is reiterated in\\nAlka Ojha Vs. Rajasthan Public Service Commission & anr., (2011)\\n9 SCC 438 wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court held:\\n“15. The question whether the candidate must have the prescribed\\neducational and other qualifications as on the particular date\\nspecified in the Rule or the advertisement is no longer res\\nintegra. In Bhupinderpal Singh v. State of Punjab this Court\\nreferred to the earlier judgments in A.P. Public Service\\nCommission v. B. Sarat Chandra, Vizianagaram Social\\nWelfare Residential School Society v. M. Tripura Sundari Devi,\\nM.V. Nair v. Union of India, Rekha Chaturvedi v. University of\\nRajasthan, U.P. Public Service Commission v. Alpana and\\nAshok Kumar Sharma v. Chander Shekhar and approved the\\nfollowing proposition laid down by the Punjab and Haryana\\nHigh Court: (Bhupinderpal Singh case, SCC p. 268, para 13)\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[10]\\n“13. … (i) that the cut-off date by reference to which the\\neligibility requirement must be satisfied by the\\ncandidate seeking a public employment is the date\\nappointed by the relevant service rules and if there be\\nno cut-off date appointed by the rules then such date\\nas may be appointed for the purpose in the\\nadvertisement calling for applications; (ii) that if there\\nbe no such date appointed then the eligibility criteria\\nshall be applied by reference to the last date\\nappointed by which the applications have to be\\nreceived by the competent authority.”\\n16. The same view was reiterated in M.A. Murthy v. State of\\nKarnataka and Ashok Kumar Sonkar v. Union of India.\\nTherefore, the Full Bench of the High Court rightly held that a\\ncandidate who does not possess a driving licence on the last\\ndate fixed for submission of the application is not eligible to be\\nconsidered for selection.”\\n[8] On the contrary, it has been submitted by Shri H.S Paonam,\\nthe learned counsel appearing for the private respondents that the\\nrespondent Nos. 3 & 5 did possess the valid Cinematograph Operator\\nLicense on the last date for submission of application forms and\\nmoreover, the petitioner has no locus standi to question the selection\\nprocess after he has participated therein and in particular, the\\nappointment of respondent No.5 who belongs to the scheduled tribe\\nagainst the seat reserved for it. He has relied upon the decision\\nrendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in B. Srinivasa Reddy Vs.\\nKarnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board Employees Assn.\\n& ors. (2006) 11 SCC 731(II), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court held:\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[11]\\n“78. The High Court, in the instant case, was not exercising\\ncertiorari jurisdiction. Certiorari jurisdiction can be exercised\\nonly at the instance of a person who is qualified to the post\\nand who is a candidate for the post. This Court in Umakant\\nSaran (Dr.) v. State of Bihar held that the appointment cannot\\nbe challenged by one who himself is not qualified to be\\nappointed. In Kumari Chitra Ghosh v. Union of India a\\nConstitution Bench of this Court held as under: (SCC p. 234,\\npara 12)\\n“12. The other question which was canvassed before the\\nHigh Court and which has been pressed before us relates\\nto the merits of the nominations made to be reserved\\nseats. It seems to us that the appellants do not have any\\nright to challenge the nominations made by the Central\\nGovernment. They do not complete for the reserved seats\\nand have no locus standi in the matter of nomination to\\nsuch seats. The assumption that if nominations to reserved\\nseats are not in accordance with the rules all such seats\\nhave not been properly filled up would be thrown open to\\nthe general pool is wholly unfounded.”\\nShri Niranjan Sanasam, the learned Government Advocate\\nhas relied upon the decision rendered in State of Maharashtra Vs.\\nAbhay & ors., 1984 (Suppl.) SCC 701.\\n[9] Before adverting to rival contentions on merit, this court deems\\nit appropriate to decide first the issue whether the petitioner has locus\\nstandi to challenge the recruitment process and in particular, the\\nappointment of the respondent No.5. It is not in dispute that pursuant to\\nthe requisition vide letter dated 28-07-2016 of the respondent No.2, a\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[12]\\nnotification was issued on 28-09-2016 for appointment to the various\\nposts including that of the Assistant Cinema Operator. The petitioner as\\nwell as the private respondent applied for it. The written test was held on\\n23-10-2016 and the viva voce was held on 25-10-2106 and the result\\nthereof was declared on 03-12-2016 and on the same day, the\\nappointment order was issued appointing the private respondents. It is\\nwell settled law that a candidate who had participated in the recruitment\\nprocess, cannot turn around and question it when the result thereof is\\nnot palatable to him. In the present case, the petitioner got an\\napplication filed through one of his counsel under the RTI Act and after\\nthe information being furnished, he, according to him, found that the\\nrespondent Nos.3 & 5 were not eligible for appointment to the post of\\nthe Assistant Cinema Operator. This is something which he came to\\nknow later. Since the question relating to eligibility goes to the root of\\nthe appointment, he cannot be said to have no locus standi to question\\nthe appointment of the respondent No.5 provided the appointment is\\nfound prima facie illegal. The answer to this issue is in the affirmative.\\n[10] As per the relevant recruitment rules, the essential\\nqualifications for the post of Assistant Cinema Operator are as under:\\n(i) Class-VIII passed;\\n(ii) Experience in Cinema Operation;\\n(iii) Holder of Operator’s Licence and\\n(iv) Knowledge of Manipuri Language.\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[13]\\nFor the present case, the requisite qualification of holding an\\noperator’s licence is relevant. The rival contention is that both the\\npetitioner and the respondent Nos.3 & 5 did not have valid\\ncinematograph operator’s license on the last date for submission of\\napplication forms. According to the petitioner, both the respondent Nos.\\n3 & 5 did not have the valid license for the reason that the dates on\\nwhich the certificates were issued, were 04-11-2016 and 13-10-2016\\nrespectively, when the last date for submission of application forms was\\n10-10-2016. In order to substantiate his contention, he has heavily relied\\nupon the condition prescribed in the Notification dated 28-09-2016 with\\nthe expression “Filled in application form along with relevant\\ndocuments should reach the office of the undersigned on or before\\n3.00 pm of 10th October, 2016”. Looking at the dates of issue bearing\\non the certificates, the copies of which have been filed along with the\\nwrit petition, the contention of the petitioner appears to be correct. But in\\nthe affidavit of the respondent No.2, it has been stated that the\\nrespondent No.3 possessed a licence issued on 16-12-2013 which was\\nvalid for three years and before the expiry of the same, a new licence\\nwas obtained on 04-11-2016. The copies of both the license are in the\\nrelevant file and only a copy of the licence dated 04-11-2016 was\\nfurnished in reply to the RTI application, as it was considered proper. A\\ncopy of the licence dated 16-12-2013 is filed along with the affidavit-in-\\nopposition. It is not clear as to how and when a copy of the licence\\ndated 04-11-2016 was filed by the respondent No.3. Since the validity\\nand correctness of the license dated 16-12-2013 and 04-11-2016 are\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[14]\\nnot the subject matter in issue herein, this court cannot go into it. But the\\nfact remains that both the license are held by the respondent No.3 and\\ntherefore, it cannot be said that the respondent No.3 was not eligible for\\nappointment to the post of the Assistant Cinema Operator. So far as the\\nrespondent No.5 is concerned, it has been contended by the counsel\\nappearing for the petitioner that the respondent No.5 was not eligible on\\nthe last date for submission of application form because the licence\\nproduced by him was issued only on 13-10-2016. In this regard, the\\nexplanation given by the respondent No.2 in its affidavit, is that along\\nwith the application, the respondent No.5 submitted a provisional\\ncertificate dated 10-10-2016 due to non-availability of licence card and\\nhis licence was produced on 13-10-2016 before the DPC process\\ncommenced. Therefore, he was allowed to sit for the written test held on\\n23-10-2016 and viva voce held on 25-10-2016 wherein he secured\\nhighest marks from amongst the candidates belonging to ST category.\\n[11] It has been vehemently submitted by the counsel appearing for\\nthe petitioner that there is no provision in the Manipur Cinematograph\\nRules, 1955 for issuing a provisional licence. He may be right to that\\nextent but it may be noted that a provisional certificate is normally\\nissued by the authority who is empowered to issue the certificate, when\\nit is unable to issue the certificate for some time for certain cogent\\nreasons. In the provisional certificate itself, it has been stated that\\nthough the respondent No.5 is qualified to hold the certificate as per the\\nrule, the same cannot be issued for want of licence cards and that it will\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[15]\\nbe issued in a week or two. The certificate was in fact issued on 13-10-\\n2016 before the common written test was held on 23-10-2016. The\\nrespondent No.5 who belongs to ST category, was appointed against\\nthe post reserved for them and the petitioner could, in no way, be\\nconsidered against the post reserved for the ST category, even\\nassuming that the respondent No.5 was found to be ineligible. No other\\ncandidate belonging to ST category seems to have any grievance on\\nthe appointment of the respondent No.5 and moreover, the issuance of\\nthe provisional certificate, at the most, can be said to be irregular for no\\nfault of the respondent No.5. Had the respondent No.5 not been allowed\\nto sit for the test on the ground that it was only a provisional certificate,\\nhe would have lost, in his career, the opportunity of being appointed as\\nthe Assistant Cinema Operator and on top of that, this is not the case\\nwhere this court ought to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction for the\\nreason that the recruitment process had already completed without any\\nobjection from any angle and the appointment order had been issued\\ntwo years ago. Interference by this court at this stage without any\\njustifiable reasons will be highly unfair and unreasonable. After the\\nhearing was over, a file pertaining to this case was handed over to this\\ncourt by the Government Advocate for perusal by this court and on\\nperusal thereof, it is seen that so far as the respondent No.3 is\\nconcerned, the certificates dated 16-12-2013 and 04-11-2016 issued in\\nhis favour are in the file. In respect of the respondent No.5, the\\nprovisional certificate dated 10-10-2016 alleged to have been filed by\\nhim, is not there in the file. Similarly, the sheet showing the renewals of\\nW.P. (C) No. 314 of 2017 Contd…/-[16]\\nthe petitioner’s licence filed along with the reply affidavit dated 04-03-\\n2019 is not available in the file. These are disputed questions of facts\\nwhich cannot be gone into by this court in view of the observations\\nmade hereinabove. Moreover, there is hardly any difference between\\nthe petitioner and the respondent No.5 in respect of the essential\\nqualification as regards the holding of Cinematograph Operator Licence.\\nKeeping in mind the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present\\ncase, this court is not inclined to interfere with the appointment order\\ndated 03-12-2016 in respect of the respondent Nos. 3 & 5. Since the\\ncontention of the counsel appearing for the petitioner is devoid of any\\nmerit and is not convincing, there is no need of going into the\\ncorrectness of the argument advanced by the counsel appearing for the\\nprivate respondents that the petitioner was ineligible for appointment to\\nthe post of the Assistant Cinema Operator. Thus, the instant writ petition\\ndeserves for dismissal.\\n[12] In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove,\\nthe instant writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.\\nJUDGE\\nFR/ NFR\\nDevananda\\nW.P.

Hence, the said\\nNotification No. 16/20/2016 R. dated 8th December 2016 is bad.\\nPetitioners’ Case\\n[5] The following contentions were raised by the petitioners on the\\nfollowing grounds :\\n“(i) because, the Respondent No. 1 has no authorities to pass the\\nimpugned order without referring the matter to the HAC as the\\ncreation of hill district falls within the purview of HAC and ADC.\\n(ii) because, Article 371C mandated in favour of the HAC so as to protect\\nthe right of the People of the Hill Areas as guaranteed under sub-\\nclause (a) of clause (5) of para 4 of the Manipur Legislative Assembly\\n(HAC) order, 1972 read with para 3 and 4 of the said order, 1972.\\n(iii) because, creation/upgradation of Hill District is amounting to\\ndevelopment and economic planning which is within the purview of\\nHill Area Committee guaranteed under item (1) of the schedule matter\\nof the second schedule of Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Area\\nCommittee) order, 1972.\\n5(iv) because, the impugned order was issued without the sanction of the\\nstatute and Rules as such, the impugned order is ab-initio void which\\nis not binding.\\n(xii) because, even a right decision by wrong forum is nullity which\\ncannot be binding upon the Parties as reported in AIR 1987 SC 535.\\n(xviii) because, the revenue commissioner has issued the impugned order\\nwithout consulting the Stakeholder/ Land owner which is malafide as\\nsuch this Hon‟ble High Court may kindly unveil the real circumstances\\nand intention of the respondents so as to set the thing right.\\n(xix) because, the people of Hill Areas of Manipur have their own separate\\nand distinct privileges guaranteed under Article 371C of the\\nConstitution. The people of the Hill areas are protecting their land\\nand forest according to their social custom guaranteed under Article\\n371C. In fact, the Special Provision will supersede over the General\\nRules.\\n(xxii) because, by virtue of Section 3(1) of the Manipur (Hill Area)\\nAutonomous District Council Act, 1971, the administrator shall cause\\nall the Hill Areas to be divided into not more than 6 Autonomous\\nDistrict. Hence, the Respondent No. 1 has no authority to create\\nmore than 6 Autonomous or more District without referring the\\nmatter to the Hill Area Committee (HAC)\\n(xxiii) because, by virtue of clause 2 of section 3 of the Manipur (Hill Area)\\nAutonomous District Council Act, 1971 the administrator may by order\\nnotify in official Gazette declared to be any area in the Autonomous\\nDistrict Council included within any municipality. And also increase\\ndiminish the area, unite two or more Autonomous District and also\\nalter the name any Autonomous District after consultation with the\\nHAC. However, the State Government has violated this provision by\\nnot consulting the HAC and ADC at the time of creation of 5 (five) new\\nhill Districts which is impugned herein.”\\n[6] In support of this contention, various decisions of the Supreme\\nCourt have been relied upon, the same will be dealt with later on.\\n6[7] Mr. M. Ibohal, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners\\nreferred to the provisions of the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas\\nCommittee) Order, 1972 (Annexure-A/7), hereinafter called the MLA (HAC)\\nOrder, 1972, issued by the President of India, with respect to the State of\\nManipur, in exercise of power under Article 371C of the Constitution, which was\\ngazette on 10.07.1972. The petitioners relied upon Order 2, Order 3, Order 4\\nOrder 5 of the MLA (HAC) Order, 1972 and the same reads as follows:\\n“2.

The creation of new\\ndistricts in the Hill Areas fall within the jurisdiction of Hill Areas Committee. This\\napproval is necessary because of the mandate of Article 371C of the\\nConstitution of India, which protects rights of people of the hill areas. According\\nto the learned counsel for the petitioners, the Order 4 (5) (a) of the Manipur\\nLegislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972, provides that interest\\nof the people of the hill areas should be safeguarded. The creation and\\nupgradation of districts amount to development and economic growth. The\\npeople of hill areas have to be consulted as they are protected by their own\\n9social customs and rights guaranteed under Article 317C and therefore, it is\\nmandatory for the authorities to first consult the Hill Areas Committee before\\nformation of new districts. It is also further pleaded that in terms of the Manipur\\n(Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971, the hill areas cannot not be divided into\\nmore than 6 (six) autonomous districts without consulting the Hill Areas\\nCommittee. Therefore, the impugned order is bad. The learned counsel for the\\npetitioners reiterated all the pleas as extracted above.\\nGovernment’s Stand\\n[10] Affidavit-in-opposition has been filed by respondent No. 1. In\\nparticular, Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned Advocate General refers to Paragraph 2.1,\\n2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 of the affidavit-in-opposition,\\nto contend that the petitioners are misconceived, and based on a misreading\\nreadings of the law. The relevant portion of the respondents‟ reply is as follows:\\n“2.1. That as a State Government policy for administrative\\nconvenience, after considering all the relevant aspects from different\\nangles and also to meet the long standing demands of the general\\npublic for creation of new districts and in pursuance of the State\\nCabinet decision 7 (seven) new districts were created by bifurcating\\nfrom the existing districts vide Government of Manipur, Secretariat\\nRevenue Department Notification No. 16/20/2016-R dated 8th\\nDecember, 2016. In para 3 of the said notification/order which was\\nrectified by Corrigendum dated 19-12-2016 it is clearly stated that “the\\ndistrict boundaries will be as per existing boundaries of the concerned\\nSub-Division andthe final boundary of the Districts of the State will be\\ndecided by the Government on the recommendation of a District\\nBoundary Commission headed by a Retired Judge of the High Court,\\nwith Administrative Secretaries of Home, Revenue and Tribal Affairs &\\nHills of the State Government as members”.\\nThe 7 (seven) new districts are as follows:\\n(i) Jiribam District;\\n10(ii) Kangpokpi District;\\n(iii) Kakching District;\\n(iv) Tengnoupal District;\\n(v) Kamjong District;\\n(vi) Phrezawl District; and\\n(vii) Noney District.\\nThat the notification dated 08-12-2016 for creation of 7\\n(seven) new Districts including 5 (five) new districts in Hill\\nAreas were published in the Manipur Gazette Extraordinary No.\\n408 dated 9.12.2016 and Corrigendum dated 14-12-2016 in\\nthe Manipur Gazette Extraordinary No. 420 dated 14-12-2016\\nand subsequent corrigendum in respect of Para No.3 of the\\nNotification dated 08-12-2016 was issued on 19-12-2016.\\n2.2. That with the creation of these 7 (seven) new districts,\\nproper Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Office of\\nSuperintendent of Police and other Offices have been\\nestablished in these district for proper and effective\\nadministration of these new districts.\\nTrue and correct copies of the Notification dated 08-\\n12-2016, Corrigendum dated 14-12-2016 and\\ncorrigendum dated 19-12-2016 are annexed herewith\\nand marked as ANNEXUREs – C/1 (Colly).\\n2.3. That for creation of the said 5 (five) new districts in Hill\\nareas of the State prior consultation of Hill Areas Committee\\nconstituted as per the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas\\nCommittee) Order, 1972 is not required.\\n2.4. That as per Para No.4(3) of the aforesaid Presidential\\nOrder of 1972, consultation of Hill Areas Committee is confined\\nonly to the scheduled matters i.e. matters specified in the\\nSecond Schedule of the said Presidential Order. But the\\ncreation of Districts is not included in the said scheduled\\nmatters and nowhere it is mentioned in the scheduled matters.\\nAs such, it is not necessary to consult the Hill Areas\\nCommittee for creation of new Districts in Hill Areas.\\n2.5. That it is humbly submitted that creation of districts in\\nthe State is not a new one. When Manipur was merged to the\\nUnion of India it was a single district State but later on it was\\nmade into 5 (five) districts State in 1969. The five districts are\\n(i) Central; (ii) North; (iii) East; (iv) South & (v) West.\\n2.6. That in 1983, 3 (three) districts namely Imphal, Thoubal\\nand Bishnupur were created from the Central District and the\\nearlier Hill Districts were renamed as Senapati, Ukhrul,\\nChurachandpur and Tamenglong, and Chandel District was\\ncreated by merging some parts from Central District and\\nUkhrul District. In this regards and order was issued vide\\nOrder No. 43/2/81-R(Pt) dated 15-07-1983 (A/6 in the Writ\\nPetition). Thereafter in 1987, Imphal District was carved into\\n11Imphal West & Imphal East Districts with Jiribam inside Imphal\\nEast District. As such before the creation of present 7(seven)\\nnew districts vide Government Notification dated 08-12-2016.\\nThere were 9 (nine) Districts namely: -\\n(i) Imphal West;\\n(ii) Imphal East;\\n(iii) Thoubal;\\n(iv) Bishnupur;\\n(v) Ukhrul;\\n(vi) Tamenglong;\\n(vii) Chandel;\\n(viii) Senapati; and\\n(ix) Churachandpur.\\n2.7. That when districts were created, administrative\\nconvenience and historical boundaries were taken into\\nconsideration and in the mid-seventies some hill pockets in the\\nvalley were transferred to Senapati District under the Sadar\\nHills Sub-Division. The tendency to believe that each district is\\nthe domain of a particular tribe is a misinterpretation of the\\nintent for creation of the District. Boundaries of the districts\\nare strictly based on administrative convenience as well as\\nconvenience of the people residing in the said district. For\\nsettling issues of district boundary, a district Boundary\\nCommission headed by a Retired Judge of High Court was\\nconstituted vide Government Notification dated 04-10-2017\\nunder No. 16/20/2016-R(Pt)-II.\\n2.8. That it is humbly submitted that smaller areas for\\ngovernance increases its effectiveness as it is nearer to the\\npeople though there is an increase in the cost. Many villagers\\ndue to varied reasons such as distance from the district\\nheadquarter, populated by a minority community etc. feel that\\nthey are deprived from various benefits. The 9 (nine) districts\\nas was existed before the creation of 7 (seven) new districts\\ndo not satisfy the aspiration of the people in various areas\\nleading to demands for creation of more districts. Considering\\nall the aspects it was felt that 2 (two) more districts in the\\nvalley are to be created i.e. Jiribam and Kakching. Jiribam\\nfrom Imphal East because of its unique location which is far\\nfrom the district headquarter some about 222 Kms, and\\nKakching from Thoubal District because of its unique position.\\nAnd in the Hills as the areas are large though thinly populated\\nwith poor connectivity it was felt that 5 more districts were to\\nbe created by bifurcation the 5 (five) Hills Districts i.e. –\\n(i)Senapati; (ii) Ukhrul; (iii) Churachandpur; (iv) Tamenglong;\\nand (v) Chandel.\\n(i) Senapati District, considering its high population and\\ngreater territorial area, deserves to be bifurcated into\\n2(two) districts as Senapati and Kangpokpi. And\\n12creation of Kangpokpi as a District was the long\\ndemand of the people residing there;\\n(ii) Ukhrul District the second biggest in terms of size\\nalso need bifurcating, as some areas are literally in\\naccessible from the district headquarter.\\nErstwhile Chingai, Jessami, Lungchong–Maiphai &\\nUkhrul Sub-Divisions to form Ukhrul District; and\\nKasom Khullen, Kamjong, Shamphung & Phungyar\\nSub-Divisions to form Kamjong District;\\n(iii) Churachandpur is the biggest district in terms of size\\nand for better administration a new Pherzawl District,\\nwhere an ADC Office was already established, is to be\\ncreated comprising of erstwhile Sub-Divisions of\\nParbung–Tipaimukh, Pherzawl, Vangai Range &\\nThanlon; and Churachandpur District comprising of\\nSingngat, Churachandpur, Henglep, Sangaikot,\\nTuibuong, Mualnuam, Kangvai, Samulamlan & Saikot\\nSub-Divisions;\\n(iv) Tamenglong District to be bifurcated into 2 (two)\\nDistricts i.e. Tamenglong District comprising of\\nTamenglong, Tamei & Tousem Sub-Divisions; and\\nNoney District comprising of Nungba, Khoupum,\\nLongmai (Noney) & Haochong Sub-Divisions;\\n(v) Chandel District to be bifurcated into 2 (two) Districts\\ni.e. Chandel District comprising of Chandel,\\nChakpikarong & Khengjong Sub-Divisions; and\\nTengnoupal District comprising of Machi, Moreh &\\nTengnoupal Sub-Divisions, as those creations of new\\ndistricts will provide the necessary fill up for further\\ndevelopment of the border districts.\\nAs such, by implementation of the decision of the State\\nCabinet 7(seven) new districts were created vide Government\\nNotification dated 08-12-2016 bearing No.6/20/2016-R by\\nbifurcating the existing districts and the same was published in\\nthe Manipur Gazette Extraordinary No. 408 dated 09-12-2016,\\nand corrigendum dated 14-12-2016 & 19-12-2016 were also\\nissued in this regard.\\nExisting Districts New Districts\\nA.

There is no deprivation\\nof any fundamental rights/ legal rights of any person in such\\ncreation of 7 (seven) new districts. The petitioners are not at\\nall aggrieved by the creation of new districts and rather this\\ncreation will benefit the people including the Petitioners in\\nmany ways. Moreover, the creation of the 7 (seven) new\\ndistricts is a policy of the State and the Petitioners have no\\nright to challenge it.\\n2.10. That the creation of new districts have not infringed any\\nfundamental rights/ legal rights of petitioners and general\\npublic rather it benefited them in many ways. There is no\\nunconstitutionality, illegality or infirmity in such creation of\\n7(seven) new districts as there is no violation of any\\nConstitutional provisions or any Act and Rules.\\n2.11. That it is humbly submitted that there is no deprivation\\nof any fundamental or legal right or violation of any customary\\nlaw of the tribal people in such creation of 5 (five) new\\ndistricts in Hill Areas of Manipur.”\\n[11] After setting out the objective and rationale behind demarcation for\\ncreating new districts, the respondents submitted that the challenge to the\\nimpugned notification on the basis of Article 371C of the Constitution of India\\nand the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972, is\\nmisconceived. In paragraph 6.3 and 6.4, the respondents clearly states that the\\ncreation of new districts does not fall under the scheduled matters set out in\\nManipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972, and that\\nthere is no violation of Article 371C of the Constitution. It is also pleaded that\\n14the cabinet decision was taken which is based on a policy decision of the\\nGovernment. Para 6.3 and 6.4 of the affidavit-in-opposition read as follows :\\n“6.3. That it is submitted that creation of 7 (seven) new districts in\\nManipur which includes creation of 5 (five) new districts in Hill Areas of\\nManipur is the outcome of a Major Policy decision of the State which is\\nnot within the scheduled matters of the aforementioned Presidential\\nOrder, 1972. In the circumstances, creation of the new districts in Hill\\nAreas does not amount to violation of Article 371C the Constitution of\\nIndia in any form.\\n6.4. Further, the answering deponent begs to submit that the\\nimpugned order was issued in the name of the Governor of Manipur and\\ncreating of 7 (seven) new districts which include 5 (five) in Hill Areas is\\nin pursuance of a policy decision taken by the State Cabinet for\\nadministrative convenience.”\\n[12] Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned A.G. produced the original files relating to\\nthe cabinet decision as mentioned above to justify the above plea and the same\\nwas verified. The respondents further pointed out that if that the petitioners are\\nonly aggrieved by the boundaries of the new district, they can approach to the\\ncompetent authority as stated in para 6.6 of the affidavit-in-opposition, which\\nreads as follows :\\n“6.6. That it is humbly submitted that if the Petitioners feel aggrieved\\nby the boundaries of new districts in Hill Areas, they are at liberty to\\napproach the proposed District Boundary Commission headed by a\\nRetired Judge of High Court (which was duly constituted vide Order\\ndated 04-10-2017).”\\n[13] Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned Advocate General, points out that the\\nRules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Manipur Legislative Assembly\\nprovides for dealing with issues relating to the creation of districts. These rules\\nare framed in terms of power conferred upon the State Government under\\n15Article 166 (2) & (3) of the Constitution of India. By virtue of the Rules of\\nProcedure and Conduct of Business of the Manipur Legislative Assembly, the\\nGovernment has taken the decision to create new districts. The Government is\\nnot dealing with an issue covered by Schedule to the Presidential Order, 1972,\\nand therefore the petitioners‟ plea is without any legal basis and totally\\nmisconceived.\\n[14] It is a clear stand of the Government that the Schedule to\\nPresidential Order 1972 does not deal with creation of new districts. On the\\ncontrary, the Business of Government of Manipur (Allocation) Rules, 2009\\nframed under Article 166 (2) and (3) of the Constitution enables the\\nGovernment to deal with the matters relating to creation of Districts, Sub-\\nDivisions Tehsil and Villages and alteration of boundaries thereof by the\\nRevenue Department, Government of Manipur. The State emphatically denies\\nthe contention of the petitioners that the Hill area Committee should be\\nconsulted for creation of new districts as misconceived and misplaced.\\nPara 6.9 of the affidavit-in-opposition reads as follows:\\n“6.9. That from the perusal of the Presidential Order of 1972 and the\\namendment in the Rules of Business of the Government of Manipur made\\nunder Article 166 (2) & (3) of the Constitution of India and Rules of\\nProcedure and Conduct of Business in Manipur Legislative Assembly, the\\nmatter relates to the resolution/recommendation originated from the Hill\\nAreas Committee to the Government of Manipur any legislation or\\nexecutive action affecting the hill Areas with respect to any of the\\nscheduled matters. Nowhere in the scheduled maters there is mention of\\nthe creation of District. Under the Business of the Government of Manipur\\n(Allocation) Rules, 2009, all matters relating to the creation of Districts,\\nSub-Divisions, Tehsil and Villages and alteration of boundaries thereof lies\\n16with the Revenue Department, Government of Manipur. Therefore, the\\nsubmission made by the petitioners that the Hill Areas Committee has not\\nconsulted is misconceived and misplaced. The question of consulting or\\nnot consulting the Hill Areas Committee does not arise at all in the\\ncreation of the new districts in Hill Areas.”\\nMr. N. Kumarjit, learned Advocate, therefore, prayed for dismissal\\nof the PIL.\\n[15] Affidavit in rejoinder was filed by the petitioners on 11.06.2018\\ndrawing reference to Manipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971 and\\nreiterating what was pleaded earlier.\\n[16] Additional reply affidavit dated 25.08.2018 has been filed by\\nrespondent No. 1 contending that reference to Manipur (Hill Areas) District\\nCouncil Act, 1971 is totally misplaced because the scope of the Act does not in\\nany way deal with formation of new Revenue Districts. The State Government is\\nnot in any way interfering with the provisions of Manipur (Hill Areas) District\\nCouncil Act 1971. In this regard, Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned Advocate General\\nreferred to para 5, 6, 7, 8 9 & 10 of the additional affidavit of respondent No. 1,\\nwhich read as follows :\\n“5. That it is further submitted that the establishment of\\nAutonomous District Councils in the Hill areas in Manipur under the\\nprovisions of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Councils Act, 1971 is not\\naffected by the creation of 7 (seven) new revenue districts in Manipur.\\n6. That under Section 3(1) of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District\\nCouncils Act, 1971, the Hill areas in Manipur has been divided into not\\nmore than six Autonomous District Councils. In the circumstances,\\nvide Government Notification No. 18/1/71-SC dated 14-02-1972, the\\nGovernment of Manipur constituted 6 (six) autonomous districts under\\nSection 3 of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Councils Act, 1971. They\\nare as follows.\\n1) Manipur North Autonomous District\\n2) Sadar Hills Autonomous District\\n3) Manipur East Autonomous District\\n174) Tengnoupal Autonomous District\\n5) Manipur South Autonomous District\\n6) Manipur West Autonomous District.\\n7. That in course of time, the names of the 6 (six) Autonomous\\nDistricts are now re-named as follows\\n(1) Senapati Autonomous District Council, Senapati\\n(This Council has its territorial jurisdiction in the present\\nSenapati District, Manipur)\\n(2) Sadar Hills Kangpokpi Autonomous District\\nCouncil, Sadar Hills, Kangpokpi\\n(This Council has its territorial jurisdiction in the present\\nKanpokpi District, Manipur)\\n(3) Ukhrul Autonomous District Council, Ukhrul.\\n(This Council has its territorial jurisdiction in Ukhrul and\\nKamjong Districts)\\n(4) Chandel Autonomous District Council, Chandel\\n(This Council has its area of operation in Chandel and\\nTengnoupal Districts)\\n(5) Churachandpur Autonomous District Council,\\nChurachandpur.\\n(This Council has its territorial jurisdiction in\\nChurachandpur and Pherzawl Districts)\\n(6) Tamenglong Autonomous District Council,\\nTamenglong\\n(This Council has its territorial jurisdiction in Tamenglong\\nand Noney Districts.)\\n8. That it is submitted that the constitution of Autonomous\\nDistrict Councils under the provisions of the Manipur (Hill Areas)\\nDistrict Councils Act, 1971 is a separate activities/process and the\\nsame is not related with the creation of Revenue Districts. Before the\\ncreation of these 7 (seven) new Revenue Districts there were 2 (two)\\nAutonomous District Councils in Senapati (Manipur North) District ; viz.\\n(1) Senapati Autonomous District Council, Senapati and (2) Sadar Hills\\nAutonomous District Council, Sadar Hills, Kangpokpi.\\n9. That in course of time the State of Manipur for administrative\\nconvenience in Hill Areas, may create more Autonomous District\\nCouncils if required by amending the provisions of the Manipur (Hill\\nAreas) District Councils Act, 1971. In such event the State is bound to\\nconsult the Hill Areas Committee.\\n10. That it is re-iterated that the consultation of Hill Areas\\nCommittee is not at all required at the time of creation of the said 7\\n(seven) new Districts in Manipur or in the creation of Revenue District\\nin Manipur as the same is not attracted by the provisions under Article\\n371C of the Constitution of India. ”\\n18[17] In support of this affidavit, the notification dated 14.02.1972 and\\nsubsequent notifications have been enclosed. It is pleaded that the provisions of\\nManipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971 provides for creation of new\\nautonomous districts. The State Government has not altered the autonomous\\ndistrict. No new autonomous district is formed. There is a marked and distinct\\ndifference between Revenue districts and Autonomous districts. They have an\\nindependent and specific role to play in the administration. The petitioners are\\ndeliberately confusing autonomous districts with regular revenue districts. If and\\nwhen new autonomous districts are to be created, then consultation with Hill\\nAreas Committee has to be undertaken.\\n[18] The function of District Council has been clearly set out in Section\\n29 of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Councils Act, 1971, and it does not in any\\nway deal with formation of new districts. Section 29 of the Manipur (Hill Areas)\\nDistrict Councils Act, 1971 reads as follows :\\n“Functions of District Councils\\n29 (1) Subject to such exceptions and conditions as the Administrator\\nmay make and impose, the following matters shall be under the control\\nand administration of a District Council, namely –\\ni) the maintenance and management of such property, movable and\\nimmovable, and institutions as may be transferred to that Council\\nby the Administrator;\\nii) the construction, repair and maintenance of such of the roads,\\nbridges, channels and buildings as may be transferred to that\\nCouncil by the Administrator;\\niii) the establishment, maintenance and management of primary\\nschools and construction and repair of all buildings connected with\\nthese institutions and institution of scholarships;\\niv) the establishment, maintenance and management of dispensaries;\\nv) the establishment and maintenance of cattle pounds including\\nsuch functions under the Cattle-trespass Act, 1871 as may be\\ntransferred to that Council by the Administrator;\\n19vi) the establishment, maintenance and management of markets and\\nfairs and the construction, repair and maintenance of all buildings\\nconnected therewith;\\nvii) the supply, storage and prevention from pollution of water for\\ndrinking, cooking and bathing purposes;\\nviii)t he construction, repair and maintenance of embankments and\\nthe supply, storage and control of water for agricultural purposes.;\\nix) The preservation and reclamation of soil;\\nx) the preservation, protection and improvements of livestock and\\nprevention of animal diseases;\\nxi) public health and sanitation;\\nxii) the management of such ferries as may be entrusted to the\\ncharge of that Council by the Administrator;\\nxiii) the initiation, inspection and control of relief works;\\nxiv)t he allotment, occupation or use, or the setting apart of land,\\nother than land acquired for any public purpose or land which is a\\nreserved forest, for the purpose of agriculture or grazing or for\\nresidential or other non-agricultral purposes or for any other\\npurposes likely to promote the interest of the inhabitants of any\\nvillage or town situated within the autonomous district for which\\nthat council is constituted;\\nxv) the management of any forest not being a reserved forest;\\nxvi)t he regulation of the practice of Jhum or other form of shifting\\ncultivation and;\\nxvii) any other matter which the Administrator may, in consultation\\nwith the Hill Areas Committee, entrust to the District Council in\\nthe field of agriculture, animal husbandry, community\\ndevelopment, social and tribal welfare, village planning or any\\nother matter referred to in section 52 of the government of Union\\nTerritories Act, 1963.\\n2. It shall be competent for a District Council to recommend to the\\nGovernment of the Union territory of Manipur legislation relating to the\\nfollowing matters in so far as they concern members of the Scheduled\\nTribes, namely\\n(a) appointment or succession of Chiefs;\\n(b) inheritance of property;\\n(c) marriage and divorce;\\n(d) social customs;\\nNone of the above provides for consultation for formation of new\\ndistricts. It is, therefore, pleaded that the petition has to be dismissed as it is\\nbased on misconception of law.\\n20Case laws relied upon by the petitioners\\n[19] The petitioners counsel relied upon the decision of the Supreme\\nCourt in the case of Tata Cellular Vs. Union of India reported in (1996)\\nAIR(SC) 11 and pleaded that the decision making process is faulted because\\nthe consultation with the Hill Area Committee as required under Presidential\\nOrder, 1972 has not been done and therefore, the impugned notification is bad.\\nIn the above case law, para 90, 91, 92, 93 & 94 which are relevant read as\\nfollows :\\n“90. Judicial Review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the\\ndecision in support of which the application for judicial review is made,\\nbut the decision-making process itself.\\n91. In Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans [1982] 3 All\\nER 141 Lord Brightman said:\\n“Judicial Review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a\\ndecision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was\\nmade.\\nJudicial Review is concerned, not with the decision, with the\\ndecision-making process. Unless that restriction on the power of\\nthe Court is observed, the Court will, in my view, under the guise\\nof preventing the abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping\\npower.”\\nIn the same case Lord Hailsham commented on the purpose of the\\nremedy by way of judicial review under RSC Ord 53 in the following term:\\nThis remedy, vastly increased in the extent, and rendered, over a\\nlong period in recent years, of infinitely more convenient access than that\\nprovided by the old prerogative writs and actions for a declaration, is\\nintended to protect the individual against the abuse of power by a wide\\nrange of authorities, judicial quasi-judicial, and, as would originally have\\nbeen thought when I first practiced at the Bar, administrative. It is not\\nintended to take away from those authorities the powers and discretions\\nproperly vested in them by law and to substitute the courts as the bodies\\nmaking the decisions. It is intended to see that the relevant authorities\\nare their powers in a proper manner,\\nR v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex p Datafin plc. Sir John\\nDonaldson MR commented : „an application for judicial review is not an\\nappeal‟. In lonrho plc v. Secretary of State for Trade and Indusry. Lord\\nKeith said: „Judicial review is a protection and not a weapon.‟ It is thus\\n21different from an appeal. When hearing an appeal the Court is concerned\\nwith the merits of the decision under appeal. In Re Amin, Lord Fraser\\nobserved that:\\n“Judicial review is concerned not with the merits of a\\ndecision but with the manner in which the decision was made ...\\nJudicial review is entirely different from an order appeal. It is made\\neffective by the court quashing an administrative decision without\\nsubstituting its own decision, and is to be contrasted with an appeal\\nwhere the appellate tribunal substitutes its own decision on the\\nmerits for that of the administrative officer.”\\n92. In R v. Penal on Take-overs and Mergers, ex p Guinness plc [1990] 1\\nQB 146 Lord Donaldson MR referred to the Judicial review jurisdiction as\\nbeing supervisory or „longstop‟ jurisdiction. Unless that restriction on the\\npower of the courts is observed, the court will, under the guise of\\npreventing the abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power.\\n93. The duty of the court is to confine itself to the question of legality. Its\\nconcern should be :\\n1. Whether a decision-making authority exceeded its powers?\\n2. committed an error of law\\n3. committed a breach of the rules of natural justice\\n4. reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal would have\\nreached or\\n5. abused its powers\\n94. Therefore, it is not for the court to determine whether a particular\\npolicy or particular decision taken in the fulfillment of that policy is fair. It\\nis only concerned with the manner in which those decisions have been\\ntaken. The extent of the duty to act fairly will vary from case to case,\\nshortly put, the grounds upon which an administrative action is subject to\\ncontrol by judicial review can be classified as under :\\n(i) Illegality: This means the decision-maker must understand\\ncorrectly the law that regulates his decision-making power and\\nmust give effect to it.\\n(ii) Irrationality, namely, Wednesbury unreasonableness,\\n(iii) Procedural impropriety.\\n[20] Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon decision of Supreme\\nCourt in the case of Asif hameed & Ors. Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir\\n& Ors. reported in (1989) AIR SC 1899, to plead that the Court can examine\\naction of the Government whether it is in accordance with law and whether the\\nExecutive has acted within powers and functions assigned under Constitution.\\n22Failure to follow the edict of law, the Court should strike down such action.\\nRelevant para 19 reads as follows:\\n“19. When a State action is challenged, the function of the court is to\\nexamine the action in accordance with law and to determine whether the\\nlegislature or the executive has acted within the powers and functions\\nassigned under the Constitution and if not, the Court must strike-down the\\naction. While doing so the court must remain within its self-imposed limits.\\nThe court sits in judgment on the action of a coordinate branch of the\\nGovernment. While exercising power of judicial review of administrative\\naction, the court is not an appellate authority. The Constitution does not\\npermit the court to direct or advise the executive in matters of policy or to\\nsermonize qua any matter which under the Constitution lies within the\\nsphere of legislature or executive, provided these authorities do not\\ntransgress their constitutional limits or statutory powers.”\\nDecisions relied upon by the State\\n[21] Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned Advocate General relied upon the decision\\nof Supreme Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. Vs.\\nChaudhari Ran Beer Singh & Anr. Reported in (2008) 5 SCC 550 to state\\nthat in matters of policy decision of the State Government, the scope of\\ninterference by the Court is limited. Relevant para 13 is as follows:\\n“ 13. Cabinet‟s decision was taken nearly eight years back and\\nappears to be operative. That being so there is no scope for directing\\nreconsideration as was done in Ram Milan case, though learned\\ncounsel for the respondents prayed that such a direction should be\\ngiven. As rightly contended by learned counsel for the State, in matters\\nof policy decisions, the scope of interference is extremely limited. The\\npolicy decision must be left to the Government as it alone can decide\\nwhich policy should be adopted after considering all relevant aspects\\nfrom different angles. In matter of policy decisions or exercise of\\n23discretion by the Government so long as the infringement of\\nfundamental rights is not shown, courts will have no occasion to\\ninterfere and the court will not and should not substitute its own\\njudgment for the judgment of the executive in such matters. In\\nassessing the propriety of a decision of the government the court\\ncannot interfere even if a second view is possible from that of the\\nGovernment.”\\n[22] Another decision of the Supreme Court, relied upon by A.G. is\\nParisons Agrotech Private Limited & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors\\nreported in (2015) 9 SCC 657 in case relating to challenge to a notification\\nunder Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1972 restricting the\\nimport of crude palm oil through Kohci port . In this case, Supreme Court on\\nthe power of judicial review on the policy decision held in para 14, 15 & 19 as\\nfollows :\\n“14. No doubt, the writ court has adequate power of judicial review in\\nrespect of such decisions. However, once it is found that there is\\nsufficient material for taking a particular policy decision, bringing it within\\nthe four corners of Article14 of the Constitution, power of judicial review\\nwould not extend to determine the correctness of such a policy decision\\nor to indulge into the exercise of finding out whether there could be more\\nappropriate or better alternatives. Once we find that parameters of Article\\n14 are satisfied; there was due application of mind in arriving at the\\ndecision which is backed by cogent material ; the decision is not arbitrary\\nor irrational and ; it is taken in public interest, the Court has to respect\\nsuch a decision of the executive as the policy making is the domain of the\\nexecutive and the decision in question has passed the test of judicial\\nreview.\\n15. In Union of India v Dinesh Engg. Corpn., this Court delineated the\\naforesaid principle of Judicial review in the following manner : (SCC pp.\\n498-99, para 12)\\n24“12. There is no doubt that this Court has held in more than\\none case that where the decision of the authority is in regard\\nto the policy mater, this Court will not ordinarily interfere since\\nthese policy matters are taken based on expert knowledge of\\nthe persons concerned and the courts are normally not\\nequipped to question the correctness of a policy decision. But\\nthen this does not mean that the courts have to abdicate their\\nright to scrutinize whether the policy in question is formulated\\nkeeping in mind all the relevant facts and the said policy can\\nbe held to be beyond the pale of discrimination or\\nunreasonableness, bearing in mind the material on record ...\\nAny decision, be it a simple administrative decision or a policy\\ndecision, if taken without considering the relevant facts, can\\nonly be termed as an arbitrary decision. If it is so, then be it a\\npolicy decision or otherwise, it will be violative of the mandate\\nof Article 14 of the Constitution.”\\n19. We would also like to refer to the judgment of this Court in\\nPremier Tyres Ltd. v. Kerala SRTC wherein this Court held that when a\\npolicy decision is taken in the public interest, courts need not tinker with\\nthe same.\\n[23] In policy matters, the role of Court is very limited has been\\nreiterated by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dilip Kumar\\nGarg & Anr. Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. Reported in (2009) 4 SCC\\n753. Para 15 reads as follows :\\n“15. In our opinion, Article 14 should not be stretched too far,\\notherwise it will make the functioning of the administration impossible.\\nThe administrative authorities are in the best position to decide the\\nrequisite qualifications for promotion from Junior Engineer to Assistant\\nEngineer, and it is not for this Court to sit over their decision like a court\\nof appeal. The administrative authorities have experience in\\nadministration, and the Court must respect this, and should not interfere\\n25readily with administrative decisions. (See Union of India v. Pushpa Rani\\nand Official Liquidator v. Dayanand)\\nAnalysis and Reasoning\\n[24] In the present case, the impugned proceeding has been issued by\\nthe Governor of the State of Manipur in exercise of power under Article 154 of\\nthe Constitution which reads as follows :\\n“154. Executive power of State :- (1) The executive power of\\nthe State shall be vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him\\neither directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with\\nthis Constitution.\\n(2) Nothing in this article shall-\\n(a) be deemed to transfer to the Governor any functions\\nconferred by any existing law on any other authority ; or\\n(b) prevent Parliament or the Legislature of the State from\\nconferring by law functions on any authority subordinate to\\nthe Governor.”\\n[25] The Governor while exercising such power under Article 154 will be\\nlimited to such extent as defined under article 162. This will be on the basis of\\nthe advice of the council of ministers as provided under Article 163 on whose\\nadvice, the impugned notification has been issued. Article 162 and 163 of the\\nConstitution read as follows :\\n“162. Extent of executive power of State – Subject to the\\nprovisions of this Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend\\nto the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has\\npower to make laws;\\nProvided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of\\na State and Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of\\nthe State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power\\nexpressly conferred by this Constitution or by any law made by Parliament\\nupon the Union or authorities thereof.\\n26163. Council of Ministers to aid and advise Governor – (1)\\nThere shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to\\naid advise the Governor in exercise of his functions, except in so far as he\\nis by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of\\nthem in his discretion.\\n(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a mater as\\nrespects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to\\nact in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be\\nfinal, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called\\nin question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his\\ndiscretion.\\n(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered\\nby Ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into any Court.”\\n[26] The conduct of Business of the Government of the State is\\ngoverned by Article 166. The Business of the Government of Manipur\\n(Allocation) Rules, 2009 has been issued on 08.06.2009 amending the Business\\nof Government of Manipur (Allocation) Rules, 1972 by virtue of clause 2 & 3 of\\nArticle 166 of the Constitution of India. Article 166 of the Constitution reads as\\nfollows:\\n“166. Conduct of business of the Government of a State – (1)\\nAll executive action of the Government of a State shall be expressed to\\nbe taken in the name of the Governor.\\n(2) Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of\\nthe Governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in\\nrules to be made by the Governor, and the validity of an order or\\ninstrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the\\nground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the\\nGovernor.\\n(3) The Governor shall make rules for the more convenient\\ntransaction of the business of the Government of the State, and for the\\nallocation among Ministers of the said business in so far as it is not\\nbusiness with respect to which the Governor is by or under this\\nConstitution required to act in his discretion”\\n[27] Rule 30 of the Business of the Government of Manipur (Allocation)\\nRules, 2009, deals with Revenue Department. For better clarity, Rule 30 (viii)\\n27which relates to creation of Districts, Sub-divisions, Tehsil villages, Villages and\\nalteration of boundaries, is extracted below :\\nBusiness of the Government of Manipur (Allocation) Rules, 2009\\n“30 REVENUE DEPARTMENT\\n(viii) All matters relating to the creation of Districts, Sub-Divisions,\\nTehsil and Villages and alteration of boundaries thereof.”\\n[28] In the present case, the State Government relied upon the Business\\nof the Government of Manipur (Allocation) Rules, 2009 framed under Article 166\\nand on the basis of the advice of council of Ministers under Article 163 of the\\nConstitution to exercise executive powers of the State as provided under Article\\n162 to form new districts. It is apparent from the above that the impugned\\nnotification is constitutionally valid for the aforesaid reason.\\n[29] The contention of the petitioners that the impugned notification is\\nbad on account of failure to comply with the procedural requirement of the\\nManipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971 and Manipur Legislative Assembly\\n(Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972 dated 10.07.1972. The petitioners relied\\nupon Article 371C of the Constitution which reads as follows :-\\n“371-C. Special provision with respect to the State of\\nManipur – Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the President\\nmay, by order made with respect to the State of Manipur, provide for the\\nconstitution and functions of a committee of the Legislative Assembly of\\nthe State consisting of members of that Assembly elected from the Hill\\nAreas of that State, for the modifications to be made in the rules of\\nbusiness of the Government and in the rules of procedure of the\\nLegislative Assembly of the State and for any special responsibility of the\\nGovernor in order to secure the proper functioning of such committee.\\n(2) The Governor shall annually, or whenever so required by the\\nPresident, make a report to the President regarding the administration of\\nthe Hill Areas in the State of Manipur and the executive power of the\\n28Union shall extend to the giving of directions to the State as to the\\nadministration of the said areas.”\\n[30] A reading of Article 371C of the Constitution and the Manipur\\nLegislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972 which was issued on\\n10.07.1972 invoking the power under Article 371 C, it is evident that the Hill\\nAreas Committee is constituted from amongst members of assembly who hail\\nfrom the Hill areas and for the time being representing the Assembly\\nconstituencies situated wholly or partly in the hill areas of the State.\\n[31] Order 4 of the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee)\\nOrder, 1972 deals with functions of the Hill Areas Committee. Clause (3) of\\nOrder 4 provides that Hill Area Committee will have the right to consider and\\npass resolutions recommending to the Government of the State any legislation\\nor executive action affecting the Hill Areas with respect to any scheduled\\nmatter.\\n[32] Scheduled matter is defined in Order 2(f) and it deals with as\\nfollows :\\n(1) Development and economic planning within the Plan\\nallocations for the Hill Areas.\\n(2) Constitution and power and functioning of District Councils\\nin the Hill Areas\\n(3) The allotment, occupation, or use, or the setting apart of land\\n(other than any land which is a reserved forest) for the purposes of\\nagriculture or grazing or for residential or other non-agricultural purposes\\nor for any other purpose likely to promote the interests of the inhabitants\\nof any village or town situated within the Hill areas.\\nProvided that nothing in this item shall apply to lands acquired for\\nany public purpose or the acquisition of land, whether occupied or\\nunoccupied, for any public purpose in accordance with any law for the\\ntime being in force authorizing such acquisition.\\n(4) The management of any forest not being a reserved forest.\\n29(5) The use of any canal or water course for purposes of\\nagriculture.\\n(6) The regulation of the practice of Jhum or other forms of\\nshifting cultivation.\\n(7) The establishment of village committees or Councils and their\\npowers, and other matter relating to village administration.\\n(8) Public health and sanitation.\\n(9) The appointment or succession of Chiefs or Headman.\\n(10) The inheritance of property.\\n(11) Marriage and divorce\\n(12) Social customs\\n(13) Any other matter which the Assembly may by resolution\\ndeclare to be a matter which shall come within the purview of the Hill\\nAreas Committee.”\\n[33] From the above, it is very clear that none of the clauses in the\\nschedule provides for the demarcation or creation of the district or for dealing\\nwith the issue relating to formation of new districts.\\n[34] Even as per the Brief History of District Creation in Manipur,\\nsubmitted by the petitioner and the respondent State, it is evident that Manipur\\nwas a single District between 18.01.1950 and 13.11.1969 in and by order dated\\n18.01.1950. It is pertinent to point out that the entire territory of the princely\\nstate of Manipur merged with the dominion of India on 15.10.1949. The entire\\nterritory of Manipur was divided into 5 districts, by Order no 20/39/69–D, dated\\n12.11.1969 with effect from 14.11.1969, namely, (1) Manipur Central District,\\n(2) Manipur North District, (3) Manipur South District (4) Manipur East District\\nand (5) Manipur west District.\\nTengnoupal District was created on 13.5.1974. Thereafter, w.e.f\\n25.5.1983, three districts were carved out of Manipur Central District, namely,\\n(1) Imphal District, (2) Bishnupur District and (3) Thoubal District.\\n30Thereafter in 1977, Imphal District was divided into two districts,\\nnamely, (1) Imphal East District and (2) Imphal West District. Thereafter, the\\npresent new 7 districts were created by the impugned notification dated\\n08.12.2016.\\n[35] From this, it is clear that the creation of Districts has been\\nhappening from time to time by the order of the Government for the purpose of\\nbetter administration and management of districts. It is an exercise for effective\\nreach of the executive in pursuit of good governance which is the hallmark of\\nthe democracy.\\n[36] The main thrust of the argument of the counsel for the petitioners\\nis that the Presidential Order, (i.e.) the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas\\nCommittee) Order, 1972, has been ignored and therefore, the impugned\\nnotification is bad has no legal basis. The said argument is a fallacy and legally\\nnot tenable.\\n[37] Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned Advocate General rightly pleaded that this\\ncontention is legally not tenable and based on a misreading of the Article 371C\\nof the Constitution and the Presidential Order, 1972. The impugned provision\\ndoes not in any way affects the right of the people of the hill areas because\\nArticle 371C provides for the formation of Hill Areas Committee constituted from\\namongst the elected representatives of the Assembly Constituency hailing from\\nthe hill areas for specified role set out in the schedule. That Presidential Order is\\nthe Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972. The\\npresidential order, 1972 is well defined on its scope and extent and it specifically\\ndeals with the matter specified in the Schedule to the Presidential Order, 1972.\\n31On reading of the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order,\\n1972 and the schedule, there is no scope for the Government to seek the\\napproval of the Hill Areas Committee for the purpose of formation a new district.\\nWhen the statute does not provide for such a procedure, it is a fallacy to plead\\nso. The impugned proceeding has been passed by the Governor on the basis of\\nthe aid and advice of the council of ministers and on the basis of the power\\nvested with the Government, after following the procedure prescribed under the\\nBusiness of the Government of Manipur (Allocation) Rules, 2009, framed under\\nArticle 166 of the Constitution, which specifically deals with formation of new\\ndistricts. Hence, the action of the State in the formation of districts cannot be\\nfaulted.\\n[38] Thus, the State has acted within its limit and power. It has not\\ntransgressed the Constitution mandate or any other provision of law. The action\\nof the State Government in forming new districts cannot be faulted for any\\nreason as pleaded.\\n[39] Furthermore, in this case it is a policy decision of the State\\nGovernment to further divide the districts for the welfare of the people. This has\\nbeen clearly specified in the reply affidavit. It is intended for better reach and to\\nensure that the people of the far flung areas are better governed. The objective\\nof the State Government is laudable. It is to be noted that the State of Manipur\\nis mostly mountainous and the terrain is harsh and inaccessible. The creation of\\nnew districts will be to the benefit of the people of the particular area.\\n[40] Therefore, dividing the districts into smaller districts for effective\\nadministration is a welcome measure and such a policy decision cannot be\\n32faulted or interfered with by way of judicial review as has been emphasized by\\nthe Supreme Court in so many decisions which have already been referred to\\nabove. The decision relied upon by the petitioner on judicial review of State\\naction has no relevance to the facts of the present case. The proposition in\\nTata Cellular case (Supra) and the case of Asif hameed & Ors (Supra) will\\nnot apply to the facts of the present case as the law relied upon by the\\npetitioners has no relevance to the issue of formation of new revenue districts.\\n[41] The petitioners‟ contention that the autonomous hill district is\\nsought to be interfered with, by the creation of new revenue districts is totally\\ndenied by the State Government and rightly so. The legislation on autonomous\\nhill district operates on a different field. The formation of new districts is entirely\\non a different legal framework. The attempt of the petitioners to muddle the\\nissue referring to the provisions of Manipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971\\nand the MLA (HAC) Order, 1972, is an attempt in thin air and deliberate\\nmisinterpretation of the provisions of the 1971 Act which has no application to\\nthe issue in the present case. The creation of revenue districts and the scope\\nand power of autonomous hill districts are distinct and different. It cannot be\\nclubbed together and create fiction as has been done by the petitioners. The\\nSupreme Court in the case of K.T.M.S. Mohd. and Another. V Union of\\nIndia reported in (1992) 3 SCC 178 has rejected such a plea as\\nimpermissible. Para 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 & 30 are as follows :\\n“25. Needless to emphasise that the FERA and the I.T. Act are\\ntwo separate and independent special Acts operating in two different\\nfields.\\n26. This Court in Ravula Subba Rao v. CIT has pointed out:\\n33“The Indian Income Tax Act is a self-contained Code\\nexhaustive of the matters dealt with therein, and its provisions\\nshown an intention to depart from the common rule, qui facit\\nper alium facit per se.”\\n27. Further, in Pannalal Binjraj v. Union of India, it has been\\nobserved thus:\\n“It has to be remembered that the purpose of the Act is\\nto levy income tax, assess and collect the same. The preamble\\nof the Act does not say so in terms it being an Act to\\nconsolidate and amend the law relating to income tax and\\nsuper tax but that is the purpose of the Act as disclosed in the\\npreamble of the First Indian Income Tax Act of 1886 (Act II of\\n1886). It follows, therefore, that all the provisions contained in\\nthe Act have been designed with the object of achieving that\\npurpose.”\\n28. Coming to the FERA, it is a special law which prescribes a\\nspecial procedure for investigation of breaches of foreign exchange\\nregulations. Vide Shanti Prasad Jain v. Director of Enforcement. The\\nproceedings under the FERA are quasi-criminal in character. It is pellucid\\nthat the ambit, scope and intendment of these two Acts are entirely\\ndifferent and dissimilar.\\n29. Therefore, the significance of a statement recorded under the\\nprovisions of FERA during the investigation or proceeding under the said\\nAct so as to bring them within the meaning of judicial proceeding must\\nbe examined only qua the provisions of FERA but not with reference to\\nthe provisions of any other alien Act or Acts such as I.T. Act.\\n30. If it is to be approved and held that the authorities under the\\nI.T. Act can launch a prosecution for perjury on the basis of a statement\\nrecorded by the Enforcement Officer then on the same analogy the\\nEnforcement authority can also in a given situation launch a prosecution\\nfor perjury on the basis of any inculpatory statement recorded by the\\nIncome Tax authority, if repudiated subsequently before the\\nEnforcement authority. In our opinion, such a course cannot be and\\nshould not be legally permitted.”\\nThe above decision is a clear answer to the petitioners‟ confusion.\\n[42] The Autonomous Hill Districts are governed by a separate\\nlegislation namely, the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Councils Act, 1971 as\\namended. There have been several amendments to the said Act. The\\nautonomous districts are not relevant in so far as the formation of revenue\\ndistricts are concerned. The State Government by the impugned proceeding has\\n34not in any way tampered with the existing autonomous districts which are\\ngoverned by the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Councils Act, 1971 as amended.\\n[43] In the reply affidavit, the State has emphatically denied the\\ncontention of the petitioners stating that under no circumstances, the impugned\\nnotification will have any effect in so far as the autonomous hill district council is\\nconcerned. The said contention has legal basis and is justified.\\nResult\\n[44] In the result, the contention of the petitioners that the impugned\\nnotification is in violation of the provision of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District\\nCouncils Act, 1971 or the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee)\\nOrder, 1972 has no legal basis and the imputation of the petitioners that the\\nimpugned notification is arbitrary, irrational and unlawful cannot be sustained.\\nAll the above pleas are rejected as legally untenable and unsustainable.\\n[45] We find no error in the impugned notification dated 08.12.2016.\\nWe hold that the State Government was well within its powers to issue the\\nimpugned notification.

Shri. R.B.Malpani, Advocate for plaintiff.\\nAdv. Shri. A.F.Gaikwad, Advocate for Defendant\\nJ U D G M E N T\\n( Delivered on 07th day of April, 2014 )\\n1] This is a suit for mandatory injunction.\\n2] Plaintiff's case can be summarized as under \\xad\\nPlaintiff is possessor of 68 R agricultural land bearing Gat\\nNo.76/1 to 7/6 situated at Bhagur, Tal & Dist Nashik. (For sake of brevity\\nhere and after referred as “suit property”) Suit property is owned by\\nRamchandra Dhanaji Jadhav and his family members. They have\\nexecuted a registered Development Agreement and power of attorney\\ndated 20/8/2002 and accordingly the possession of suit property is handedRohington V/s Yadav 2 RCS No. 325/2012(J)\\nover to plaintiff. Accordingly, plaintiff mutated his name in revenue\\nrecord of suit property. Defendant has no legal right over suit property.\\nEven then, with mala\\xadfide intention, defendant entered into suit property\\non 26/4/2012 with others and erected tin shed over it. Bhaskar Daulat\\nPawar, the servant of plaintiff, takes care and look after the suit property.\\nDefendant and his armed companion have threatened and constrained him\\nto leave the suit property. Bhaskar Pawar informed plaintiff. Police tried\\nto stop defendant, but partial work was completed. Plaintiff already\\nerected a site office and two sheds ad\\xadmeasuring 100 feet each in\\nSept/October 2002. Defendant claimed ownership over 475 Sq. meter,\\nout of suit property and filed suit against Ramchandra Dhanaji Jadhav for\\ncancellation of sale deed which was executed in his favour, by father of\\ndefendant in the year 1968.\\n3] Plaintiff lodged police complaint against him and tried to\\nremove the tin shed, but defendant threatened him. Hence, plaintiff was\\nconstrained to file this suit and he prayed for grant of mandatory\\ninjunction to remove the erected tin shed.\\n4] Defendant appeared and filed his written statement at\\nExh.16. He denied the whole averments asserted by the plaintiff.\\nAccording to defendant, since long years his tin shed is in existence in\\nsuit property. By this suit plaintiff is trying to evict him. No cause of\\naction arose to grant any relief in favour of plaintiff.\\n5] My learned predecessor framed issues at Exh.21 and my\\nfindings are recorded against each issue for the reasons recorded below.\\nIssues Findings\\n1 Does plaintiff prove that he is in possession of In the\\nthe suit property ? affirmativeRohington V/s Yadav 3 RCS No. 325/2012(J)\\n2 Does plaintiff prove that the defendant has In the\\nconstructed tin shed ad\\xadmeasuring 8 x 8 feet affirmative\\non suit Gat No.76/1 to 7/6 on 30/04/2012 ?\\n3 Does plaintiff prove that defendant has tried to In the\\nobstruct and interfere in his peaceful affirmative\\npossession over the suit property ?\\n4 Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the reliefs In the\\nas claimed for ? affirmative\\n5 What order and decree ? As per final\\norder\\nR E A S O N S\\nAs to Issues No.1 to 4 :\\n6] In order to substantiate his claim plaintiff has examined\\nhimself at Exh. 33. He reiterated his pleadings in examination\\xadin\\xadchief.\\nHe stated that, he is in possession of suit property, on 26/4/2012\\ndefendant and his companions have erected tin shed in suit property by\\nthreatening to his servant Bhaskar Pawar. He further stated that, he is\\nlegal owner and possessor of suit property and has also erected 100 Sq.\\nfeet site office in Sept/Oct 2002. Defendant had filed a suit for declaration\\nof ownership of land ad\\xadmeasuring 475 sq.meter in suit property and\\ncancellation of sale deed executed by his father in favour of Ramchandra\\nJadhav. On 30/4/2012, he filed complaint against defendant in police\\nstation. Even though he did not stop and threatened him. To support his\\noral evidence he relied on registered development agreement dated\\n20/8/2002 at Exh.56, General Power of Attorney at Exh.55, complaint\\nagainst defendant at Deolali Camp Police Station at Exh.40.\\n7] In his cross examination he admitted that, he is not owner of\\nsuit property, in RCS No.136/2002 he was defendant and present\\ndefendant obtained a decree in his favour. He further admitted that as per\\ndevelopment agreement he had not given money to Ramchandra JadhavRohington V/s Yadav 4 RCS No. 325/2012(J)\\nand no construction work is in existence on suit property on the basis of\\ndevelopment agreement. He further denied the possession of defendant in\\nsuit property.\\n8] To substantiate the case of defendant, he has examined\\nhimself at Exh.47 and also reiterated his whole pleading. He stated that,\\nplaintiff is neither in possession nor his office is over suit property. He\\nobtained ownership and possession by filing suit, but refused to any stay\\non it. He filed partition suit RCS No.103/2007. He further stated that,\\nsince long year he is in possession of suit property. In spite of that, by\\nfiling this suit plaintiff is trying to evict his tin shed.\\n9] In his cross examination he admitted the photographs of tin\\nshed, which are at Exh.51 and 52 respectively, belongs to him. He further\\nadmitted that plaintiff is having share in suit property since year 2002.\\nAccording to transaction took place in between him and Ramchandra\\nJadhav he erected shed for the purpose of safety and watchman. He\\nfurther denied the suggestion put forth by learned advocate by plaintiff\\nregarding the erection of illegal tin shed and obstruction to the possession\\nof plaintiff.\\n10] Learned Advocate for plaintiff vehemently argued that,\\nplaintiff is owner and possessor by general development agreement and\\npower of attorney. Though defendant has obtained decree in RCS\\nNo.136/2002 and got cancellation of sale deed of suit property to the\\nextent of his share, but he does not claim any consequential relief in that\\nsuit. Furthermore, appeal is pending against that decree. In RCS\\n103/2007, defendant claimed partition and other reliefs, which is pending.\\nOn 30/4/2012 defendant constructed tin shed forcefully over suit property\\nand threatened him, therefore, plaintiff is liable to protect being lawfulRohington V/s Yadav 5 RCS No. 325/2012(J)\\npossessor of suit property. Moreover, the original owner also filed suit\\nfor cancellation of development agreement and power of attorney\\nexecuted in favour of plaintiff. Said suit is pending as RCS No.59/2005,\\nin which Court found plaintiff's possession of suit land while deciding\\napplication for temporary inunction. Under these circumstances it makes\\nclear that plaintiff is in possession of suit property and defendant has\\nerected the tin shed. On perusal of admission on record, he liable to\\nrestrain and removal of tin shed from suit property.\\n11] Learned advocate for defendant vehemently argued that,\\nplaintiff is not owner of suit property. When he is not owner, then he has\\nnot right to file suit against anybody. General Power of Attorney dated\\n20/8/2002 is not made by real owner. Therefore, this suit is liable to be\\ndismissed. He further argued that, plaintiff put up his story on the basis of\\nG.P.A. and Development Agreement of suit property, but said document\\nis not sale deed, hence he is not liable to sale to another person, because\\nsuit property is ancestral property of defendant. In view of judgment\\npassed in RCS No.136/2002 it is declared that, defendant's share is not\\nbinding to the sale deed executed by his father in favour of Ramchandra\\nJadhav. It means defendant is owner and possessor of suit property prior\\nto 2002. Plaintiff has no title and possession over suit property. Hence,\\nthe suit is liable to be dismissed.\\n12] I have considered the arguments advanced by both side.\\nPerused the oral and documentary evidence on record. Before going to\\ndiscuss in detail, it is useful to mention the facts admitted by both parties\\non record. Plaintiff got possession of suit property from Ramchandra\\nJadhav in view of Power of Attorney and Development Agreement at\\nExh. 55 and 56 respectively dated 20/8/2002. It is also admitted position\\non record that, Ramchandra Jadhav has filed RCS No.59/2005 againstRohington V/s Yadav 6 RCS No. 325/2012(J)\\nplaintiff for cancellation of Development Agreement. Defendant obtained\\ndecree in RCS No.136/2002 about sale deed dated 12/7/ 1968 that, it is\\nnot binding on the share of present defendant. It is also admitted fact that\\ndefendant filed partition suit for same property as RCS No.103/2007 and\\nthe same is pending.\\n13] Perused Development Agreement as well as Power of\\nAttorney dated 20/8/2002, reveal that, executant has bestowed the right\\nand possession of suit property in favour of plaintiff in lieu of an amount\\nof Rs. 15,00,000/\\xad. Although the Power of Attorney and said agreement is\\nnot sale deed, but it's recitals shows that, in lieu of consideration amount\\nplaintiff obtained possession of it. On the contrary, defendant has\\nadmitted said transaction, but refused plaintiff's possession and\\nownership, because sale deed is not on record. In my opinion said\\nregistered Development Agreement is not challenged by the defendant,\\nthen it cannot be said that, plaintiff has no title on the basis of said\\ndocument. Apparently, there are various civil litigations pending about\\nthe suit property. Though Court restrained present plaintiff vide decree in\\nRCS No.136/2002, not to construct over suit property, as well as by Exh.5\\norder in RCS No.59/2005 not to create third party interest or alienation.\\nEven if defendant obtained decree about his share is binding by sale deed\\nexecuted by his father in favour of Ramchandra Jadhav. Obviously, he\\nfiled partition suit on that basis which is pending. During this course,\\ndefendant erected tin shed is the submission of plaintiff. To discard this,\\nhe stated that since long he is in possession the suit property. Court\\npassed decree in his favour, therefore he became lawful owner of suit\\nproperty. To this premise there is no iota of evidence on record to show\\nthat, his previous possession in suit property. No single evidence on\\nrecord to show that prior to Power of Attorney and DevelopmentRohington V/s Yadav 7 RCS No. 325/2012(J)\\nAgreement defendant is in possession of suit property. Even if it assumed\\nthat, Court passed decree about cancellation of sale deed to the extent of\\nhis share, but in my opinion no any Court deliver possession to the\\nplaintiff of suit property. In fact, his admission is on record about\\nplaintiff obtained possession of suit property on the basis of Development\\nAgreement and General Power of Attorney. There is also admission on\\nrecord about the photographs of tin shed at Exh.51 and 52 respectively,\\nplaintiff filed it on record to show erection of it at the hands of defendant.\\nBy assumptions of various suit pending about the suit property, either it's\\nin favour of defendant or yet to be decided, but law always prevents to the\\nbreakers. Defendant without following due process of law erect tin shed,\\nwhich is always forbidden by law. To this premise, I have gone through\\nSpecific Relief Act in which mandatory injunction speaks as,\\nSec.39 : When, to prevent the breach of an obligation,\\nit is necessary to compel the performance of\\ncertain acts which the Court is capable of\\nenforcing, the Court may in its discretion\\ngrant an injunction to prevent the breach\\ncomplained of, and also to compel perfor\\xad\\nmance of the requisite acts.\\n14] In view of documents on record, I am of opinion that there is\\ncogent evidence on record, which shows that, defendant unlawfully\\nerected tin shed over suit property and it deserves to be removed. On the\\ncontrary there is no iota of evidence to support the submissions advanced\\nby the defendant. Hence, I answer Issue No.1,2,3 in the affirmative and in\\nanswer to Issue No.4 I pass the following order.\\nO R D E R\\n1] Suit is decreed with costs.\\n2] Defendant is directed to remove tin shed constructed over the\\nsuit property within 30 days from the date of judgment at his\\nown expense. In case of failure to remove the tin shed by theRohington V/s Yadav 8 RCS No. 325/2012(J)\\ndefendant as per direction supra, plaintiff is entitled to get it\\nremoved by following due process of law.\\n3] Defendant is restrained by perpetual injunction from causing\\nobstruction to the plaintiff's possession over the suit property\\notherwise than in due process of law.\\n4] If defendant follows due process of law for getting the\\npossession, this decree shall not operate against him.\\n5] Decree be drawn up accordingly.\\nDictated and pronounced in open Court.\\nDated : 7th April, 2014 (Nutan S.

In order to prove the guilt of the accused the prosecution\\nhas examined P.W. 1 Pathan who is informant in this case. He\\ndeposed that, on 20.07.2012 he was appointed as Police Constable\\nat Datta Mandir Signal since 8.00 to 14.00 and 16.00 to 21.00 hrs.\\nHe was attached to City Traffic Police Station.

He went there and intervene the quarrels but that\\npersons are not ready to listen. With the help of bit marshal both\\npersons brought to the police station along with their vehicles. The\\nmother of the accused no. 1 threatened him if he lodged the report\\nshe will file false complaint against him. So he has lodged report\\nagainst the accused persons.

Brief facts of the case of complainant are as under:\\xad\\nComplainant and accused are well known to each other.\\nAs accused required amount for the purpose of business so he asked\\nRs. 74,149/\\xad to the complainant in January, 2012. Having considered\\nhis need the complainant has given Rs. 74,149/\\xad to the accused on\\n04.01.2012. The accused again asked money as a hand loan from the\\ncomplainant of Rs.1,70,000/\\xad. The complainant has paid Rs.1,70,000/\\xad\\nto the accused by way of cheque of Bank of Baroda. In total\\ncomplainant has given Rs.2,44,149/\\xad to the accused. The accused\\nassured to the complainant that, he will pay the amount Rs.74,149/\\xad\\nwithin six months. However, he has not paid that amount as assured\\nby him.\\n3. The complainant has demanded the amount from the\\naccused. The accused has issued cheque of Union Bank of India, Jail\\nRoad, Nashik\\xadRoad bearing no.024374, dated 07.07.2012 of\\nRs.54,500/\\xad in favour of the complainant and assured the complainant\\nabout its honour. The complainant has deposited that cheque in his\\nbank namely Bank of Baroda on 29.08.2012. That cheque was\\nreturned with memo of \\'insufficient funds\\' dated 01.09.2012. The\\ncomplainant has issued notice to the accused on 28.09.2012 by\\nR.P.A.D. and that notice was received by the accused on 29.09.2012.\\nHowever, accused failed to make payment of cheque amount within\\nstatutory period. Thereupon the present complaint is filed on\\n08.11.2012. Complainant prayed to punish the accused for the offence3 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\npunishable U/sec. 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act.\\n4. In pursuance to process issued against the accused, he\\nappeared before the Court. On his appearance, his plea came to be\\nrecorded by My Learned Predecessor vide Exh.10. After recording\\nplea, trial proceeded. The record and proceeding of the case shows\\nthat, this complaint is proceeded as a Summons Case rather than as a\\nsummary trial. There is no notes of evidence taken as contemplated\\nu/s. 263 and 264 of Code of Criminal procedure,1973. (for short\\n\\'Cr.P.C.\\') In fact, there is a single evidence of complainant\\'s witness on\\nrecord, same is full fledged by way of affidavit and the witness is cross\\xad\\nexamined at length by the Ld. Advocate for accused.\\n5. On this point of denovo of trial I am guided by the ruling of\\nHon\\'ble Bombay High Court reported as, \\'Shivaji Sampat Jagatap Vs.\\nRajan Hiralala Arora and Anr [ 2006 All MR (Cri) 2612 ] The\\nHon\\'ble High Court in para 18 of it observes thus,\\n“18. Under section 263 in Chapter XXI of the Code, in\\nevery case tried summarily, the Magistrate shall enter, in\\nsuch form as the State Government may direct, is expected\\nto \"maintain the record\" as mentioned in clause (a) to (j)\\nof that section. Section 264 provides that in every case\\ntried summarily in which the accused does not plead\\nguilty,the Magistrate shall record \"the substance of the\\nevidence\" and a judgment containing \"a brief statement of\\nthe reasons\" for the finding. Thus, the indicator to know\\nas to whether the case under section 138 of the Act has\\nbeen or is being tried summarily so as to attract the\\nprovisions contained in sub\\xadsection (3) of section 326 of\\nthe Code is the compliance of section 263 and 264 of the\\nCode. In other words, a case, which is triable as\\nsummarily, and in which the record of the proceedings has\\nbeen prepared in accordance with the provisions of section\\n263 and 264 of the Code could be stated to have been\\ntried summarily for the purpose of section 326(3) and in\\nthat case the evidence recorded by one Magistrate cannot4 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\nbe read in evidence by succeeding Magistrate. The\\nsucceeding Magistrate, however, in a case, where the\\nprocedure contemplated under sections 263 and 264 of\\nthe Code in particular has not been followed, he need not\\nhold a trial denovo. In short, if no record as per sections\\n263 and 264 has been or is being maintained by the\\nMagistrate and the case has been or is being tried as a\\nregular summons case and not tried in a summary way as\\ncontemplated under sections 262 to 265 of the Code, such\\ncase shall not be considered as tried in summary way,\\nthough triable summarily as provided for under sub\\xad\\nsection (1) of section 143 of the Act, so as to attract the\\nprovisions of section 326(3) of the Code. Therefore, the\\nevidence recorded by one Magistrate in such a case may be\\nlegally read in evidence by his successor and no denovo\\ntrial shall be necessary.”\\n6. The same ratio is laid down by Hon\\'ble High Court of\\nBombay in the later Judgment, arising out of \\'Writ Petition No.3745\\nof 2011, Dinesh Thacker Vs. State of Maharashtra and Anr,\\ndelivered on 12th December 2011\\', in which the reference to\\nlandmark ruling of Hon\\'ble Apex Court reported as \\'Nitinbhai\\nSaevatilal Shah & Anr vs. Manubhai Manjibhai Panchal and Anr\\nreported in AIR 2011 SC 3076 is made. Hence, in view of above\\ndiscussion and considering the nature of evidence i.e by way of\\naffidavit and the detailed cross examination thereon, I deem it fit to\\nproceed with the matter without making the trial denovo. .\\n7. Defence of the accused is total denial. His statement u/s.\\n313 of Criminal Procedure Code which is at Exh. 42 and the defence of\\naccused that he is having gold purchase transaction with the\\ncomplainant. In that transaction he has issued blank cheque to the\\ncomplainant and he misuse it. This is false case filed against him.\\n8. In view of the material on record, the following points5 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\narose for my determination and I record my findings against each one\\nof them for the reasons stated herein below:\\nSr.No Points Findings\\n1 Whether it is proved that the cheque\\nsubject matter of the case is drawn by the … In the\\naccused on his concerned account ? affirmative\\n2 Whether it is proved that the cheque, on\\nits presentation, was dishonoured for the … In the\\nreason \\'Insufficient Funds\\' to satisfy its affirmative\\namount ?\\n3 Whether the cheque drawn by the ...In the\\naccused was in discharge of any debt or affirmative\\nliability?\\n4 Whether it is proved that the legal notice\\nwas issued to the accused by the\\ncomplainant for demand of cheque\\namount within statutory period and it\\nwas duly served on the accused and\\ndespite its service, the accused failed to .. In the\\ncomply with demand of the amount of affirmative\\ncheque ?\\n5 What Order ? … As per final\\norder\\nR E A S O N S\\n9. In order prove the guilt of accused complainant examined\\nhimself at Exh.11. The complainant also relied on documentary\\nevidence i.e. Cheque of Union Bank of Rs. 54,500/\\xad bearing No.024374\\ndated 07.07.2012 at Exh. 33, Memo of the Bank dated 01.09.2012 at\\nExh. 34, Postal receipt dated 28.09.2012 at Exh. 35, Office copy of\\nNotice dated 29.09.2012 at Exh.36, Acknowledgement Receipt at Exh.\\n37. The complainant closed his evidence pursis at Exh.40. The\\naccused has examine himself at Ex.43 and Defence witness Sachin6 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\nSunil Landage at Ex.48 .\\n10. In order to prove an offence under Section 138 of the N.I.\\nAct, it has to be proved that :\\xad\\ni) A cheque had been issued by the accused.\\nii) The said cheque had been issued towards the payment of\\nan amount of money for the discharge in whole or any part\\nof any debt or any other legal liability of the accused.\\niii) The cheque had been returned unpaid by the Bank.\\niv) The reason for non\\xadpayment of the cheque was insufficient\\nfunds etc.\\nv) The cheque was presented to the Bank within a period of\\nsix months from the date on which it is drawn or within\\nthe period of it\\'s validity, whichever is earlier.\\nvi) The payee or the holder in due course of the cheque made\\na demand for the payment of the amount of\\nmoney under the cheque by giving a notice in writing to\\nthe drawer of the cheque within 15 days of receiving the\\ninformation from the Bank regarding its dishonour.\\nvii) The drawer of the cheque fails to make the payment of\\ncheque amount within 15 days of receiving the said\\nnotice.\\n(Admitted facts )\\n11. At the outset, I would like to place on record the factual\\naspect for which there is no controversy. The signature of the accused\\non the cheque is not disputed.\\nAs to Point No.1 and 2 (Drawing of Cheque & its dishonour)13 .\\n12. These points are interlinked and can be conveniently discussed\\ntogether.7 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\n13. The cheque subject matter of the case is at Exh.33. The\\nentries as to date, amount and signature with endorsement of\\nconcerned bank are not seriously disputed by the accused. It is defence\\nof the accused submitted that cheque was filled up by different\\nhandwriting. It is well settled that, when a drawer of a cheque deliver\\na signed blank cheque, he gives an authority to the holder to put the\\ndate of his choice and the holder has authority to fill that cheque. The\\ncheque and memo filed on record attracts statutory presumption u/s.\\n118 and 139 of N.I. Act. The cheque dt. 04/07/2012 of amount\\nRs.54500/\\xad is drawn by accused on his concerned account at Union\\nBank Nashik\\xadRoad. It is bearing No.024374.The memo of the\\nconcerned bank at Exh.34, dated 01/09/2012 and bears endorsement\\nas to \\'Insufficient funds \\'. There is no fault in the cheque at Exh.33 for\\nits issuance and its dishonour for the reasons stated in the return\\nmemo.\\n14. Therefore, can be safely held that, the cheque which\\nsubject matter of the case at Exh.33 was drawn by the accused on his\\nconcerned account. Further, in view of the endorsement of concerned\\nbank on return memo at Exh.34, it can also be safely held that the\\ncheque subject matter of the case is dishonoured, when it was\\npresented for encashment to the concerned bank. Hence, I have no\\nhesitation to record my findings in affirmative as to Point No.1 and 2.\\nAs to Point No.3: (Debt and Liability)\\n15. It is well settled proposition of law that once execution of\\ncheque is duly proved the presumptions under section 118 and 139\\nrise in favour of the complainant. Therefore now it can be safely\\npresumed that the cheque is given against legally enforceable debt and\\nthat supported by valid consideration.8 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\n16. Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the accused\\nsubmitted that though the facts and circumstances on the record give\\nrise to presumptions under section 118 and 139 of the Act however\\nmerely on the basis of these presumptions it cannot be held that an\\namount of Rs.54,500/\\xad was due and payable by the accused to the\\ncomplainant. He further submitted that, the complainant did not\\nproduce his book of accounts and he was not found in maintaining the\\naccount.\\n17. In short, it is his contention that the existence of debt is not\\na matter of presumption and therefore burden of proving the debt of\\n74149/\\xadstill remains upon the complainant. But he fails to prove his\\ncase. As regards to this point, Ld. Advocate for complainant submitted\\nthat the cheque in dispute issued by the accused in discharge of legal\\nenforceable debt. Hence, the accused be convicted.\\n18. In this respect the complainant deposed that they known to\\neach other. As accused required amount for a business so he asked\\nRs.74,149/\\xad to him in January, 2012 and considering need of accused,\\nhe has given Rs. 74,149/\\xad to the accused on 04.01.2012. The accused\\nagain asked money as a hand loan from him of Rs. 1,70,000/\\xad. Then\\nhas paid Rs. 1,70,000/\\xad to the accused by way of cheque of Bank of\\nBaroda. In total he has given Rs. 2,44,149/\\xad to the accused. The\\naccused assured to him that, he will pay the amount Rs. 74,149/\\xad\\nwithin six months. At the time of receiving amount Rs. 1,70,000/\\xad\\ndated 31.03.2013 he assured that, he will pay Rs. 1,70,000/\\xad within\\ntwo to three months. However, he has not paid that amount as assured\\nby him.\\n19. In respect of amount given to the accused in January, 2012\\nthe accused has given cheque to him and that cheque for the amount9 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\nof Rs.54,500/\\xad of Union Bank of India was dishonored therefore he has\\nissued notice to the accused and as accused has not paid the amount,\\nhe has filed a complaint against the accused.\\n20. The accused examine himself at Exh.43 and deposed that\\nthe complainant used to booked gold on lower prize and sold it after\\nits prize are increases. During this transaction the complainant has\\ntaken cheques from accused as security. However in that period, the\\nrates of gold gets decreases, so complainant could not get higher\\namount .The complainant later on committed the misuse of cheque.\\nThe Defence witness at Exh.48 supported the case of accused.\\n21. I have gone through evidence on record adduce by both\\nside and I have considered the submission advance on both side.\\nHaving regard to evidence on record now it is necessary to see whether\\ncheque has issued the towards any debt or other liability or not. So far\\nas the matter of debt and other liability is concerned, it is defence of\\naccused that, he has not issued the cheque at all towards any debt or\\nother liability and there is no documentary evidence as complainant\\nhas given loan to the accused. He does not owe the same towards\\ncomplainant. While ascertaining the factum of advancement of loan,\\nthe another factor which needs to be taken into consideration is the\\nfinancial capacity of the payee to advance the loan. When complainant\\nsays that he has paid such a huge amount like Rs 74149/\\xad to the\\naccused it becomes very much necessary to see whether he was\\nfinancially sound to give this much amount to the accused. The\\naccused no where disputed that the complainant is doctor by\\nprofession and is having clinic. The accused nowhere raised the\\nobjection as to financial capacity of the complainant. So having regard\\nto all these circumstances the complainant has proved to the10 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\nsatisfaction of the court that the amount was arranged by him.\\nTherefore on the basis of this evidence on the record it can be said he\\nwas financially capable to advance aforesaid amount to the accused.\\nThus the fact that the complainant was financially capable to advance\\nthe aforesaid loan is established by the complainant.\\n22. The factor of relationship between the parties also play\\nvital role while ascertaining the genuineness of the transaction. In the\\ncase at hand no document was executed between the parties in\\nremembrance of aforesaid transaction. Therefore it is very much\\nnecessary to see whether the bond of relationship between the\\ncomplainant and the accused was so strong that he would give such a\\nhuge amount to the accused in such a casual manner and that too\\nwithout creating any document to that effect. Admittedly their is good\\nrelationship between complainant and the accused and they very well\\nknown to each other. It is defence of the accused that complainant\\nused to book gold through him. This evidence also shows that the\\ncomplainant and accused having previous financial transactions. The\\nevidence of the complainant is reliable to accept that the complainant\\nwould pay such a huge amount to the accused without creating a\\ndocument to that effect. This evidence itself would be sufficient to\\nadmit the genuineness of transaction.\\n23. Now it is necessary to see how the aforesaid cheque came\\ninto the possession of complainant. The burden to rebut the\\npresumption U/sec.139 of N.I.Act was on accused. It was for the\\naccused to show that, how cheque at Exh.33 came in possession of the\\ncomplainant. The defence of accused that the complainant used to\\nbooked gold on lower prize and sold it after its prize are increases.\\nDuring this transaction the complainant has taken 2 cheques from11 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\naccused as security and in that period, the rates of gold gets decreases,\\nso complainant could not get higher amount .The complainant later on\\ncommitted the misuse. During his cross examination the complaint has\\ndenied the suggestion regarding the same put to him. Admittedly,\\naccused has not initiated any legal proceeding against the complainant\\nfor alleged misuse of cheque. Accused during his cross examination\\nadmitted that he has no documentary evidence as complainant has\\nbook gold through him. The defence taken by accused is not probable.\\n24. As discussed above, no satisfactorily explanation as to\\nhow cheque was in possession of complainant, so it can not be held\\nthat there is no liability of accused to pay the amount of cheque to the\\ncomplainant. If there was no liability on the part of accused towards\\ncomplainant, then the accused had no occasion to issue the cheque\\nsubject matter of the case for the consideration of Rs.54500/\\xad. So far\\nas the defences of misuse of cheque and non availability of written\\ndocuments, it is not at all probable one and can not be logically\\naccepted.\\n25. The evidence of complainant show that, an amount of\\nRs.54500/\\xad was outstanding against the accused. The cheque is issued\\nby the accused towards repayment of his hand loan amount and\\ntherefore I answer point no.3 in affirmative.\\nAs to Point No.4: (Legal notice)\\n26. According to the complainant, he issued notice on\\n28/09/2012 on the residential address of the accused by registered\\npost. The office copy of it is at Exh.36. The demand notice is served on\\naccused on the address of house of accused as per acknowledgement\\nreceipt Exh.37.On the contrary it is defence of the accused that, notice\\nwas not served on the accused. It is pertinent to note that, address of12 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\nthe accused mentioned in the notice and in complaint is not disputed\\nby the accused. The summons to appear is served on accused on this\\nsame address mentioned in notice. The case would have been\\ndifferent, if the postal endorsement was stating that, the addressee\\ndoes not reside on the given address or premises was locked. Hence,\\nthe complainant being honest drawer can not be made accountable\\nfor non service of said notice to the accused. In fact, it was the duty of\\nthe accused to claim the notice and act accordingly.\\n27. Considering the fact of case in hand, there is\\npresumption about the service of notice and this defence of\\naccused is not convincing one. Thus, in view of above discussion the\\nservice of demand notice to accused and his failure to pay the amount\\nof cheque can no more be faulted. Hence, I recorded my finding as to\\npoint No.4 in the affirmative.\\n28. As discussed above cheque Exh.33 was issued by accused\\ntowards discharge of his legal liability. It was presented for\\nencashment by complainant and returned dishonored as per cheque\\nreturn memo Exh.34. Demand notice Exh.36 was duly served on\\naccused as per acknowledgement receipt Exh.37. Accused failed to\\nmake payment within period of 15 days from service of notice. The\\ningredients to constitute the offence punishable U/sec. 138 of\\nNegotiable Instrument Act are duly proved. Hence, I hold the accused\\nguilty for the offence punishable u/s. 138 of N.I. Act .Now I take pause\\nto give an opportunity to the accused to submit on the point of\\nsentence.\\nPlace:Nashik Road [A.D.Waman]\\nDate: 14/07/2014 Judicial Magistrate, First Class,\\nNashik Road.13 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\n29. I have heard accused and his counsel as well as the\\ncomplainant on the point of punishment. The accused submitted that\\nhis family consists his wife and two children and that he is the karta of\\nhis family. Therefore lenient view may be shown while imposing the\\nsentence upon him. Ld.Advocate for the accused submitted that\\naccused be released on admonition.\\n30. The complainant submitted that accused is not entitled for\\nleniency and maximum punishment be given to accused.\\n31. The sole object behind introducing the provision under\\nsection 138 was to provide speedy remedy to avoid injury or\\ninconvenience to the payee due to the unexpected disappointment of\\nthe accused to meet with his future commitments or any other\\nliabilities. It is important to note that this remedy has been provided\\nunder the act despite of the other remedies like a suit for a recovery of\\nmoney being available under other specific enactments. Therefore\\nconsidering the object of the Act and the hardship caused to the\\ncomplainant compensation needs to be granted to the complainant.\\n32. While considering the quantum of compensation the\\nfinancial position of the accused also needs to be taken into\\nconsideration. The accused state that he is karta of his family and his\\nfamily consists of his wife and two children. Therefore considering all\\nthese facts and circumstances case and the nature of offence, I am of\\nthe view that the following sentence and compensatory relief would\\nmeet the ends of justice. Furthermore the offence proved against the\\naccused being economic offence and having regard to the object of the\\nNegotiable Instrument Act behind introducing section 138 I am not\\ninclined to grant benefit of section 3 and 4 of the Probation of14 SCC No. 2236/2012 (Judgment)\\nOffenders Act to the accused. Hence order.\\nO R D E R\\n1) The accused is hereby convicted vide section 255[2]\\nof the Criminal Procedure Code 1973 of the offence\\npunishable under section 138 of the Negotiable\\nInstrument Act and sentenced to suffer simple\\nimprisonment of three months.\\n2) The accused shall pay an amount of Rs. 54,500/\\xad\\n( Rupees Fifty Four Thousand Five Hundred Only ) to\\nthe complainant towards compensation vide section\\n357 (3) of Criminal Procedure Code in default of\\nwhich the accused shall further suffer simple\\nimprisonment of two months.\\n3) Accused to surrender his bail bonds.\\n4) The right to appeal from this Judgment and order is\\nexplained to accused in vernacular.\\n5) Copy of this Judgment and order be given to the\\naccused free of costs forthwith.\\n6) Pronounced in Open Court.\\nPlace:Nashik Road [A.D.Waman]\\nDate: 14/07/2014 Judicial Magistrate, First Class,\\nNashik Road.',\n",

She run a hotel at\\nGosaviwadi by the name Alfaran Hotel. Accused Jamir run a cycle shop\\nnext to the hotel of informant. In front of this shop he also run a stall of\\n“Anda Bhurji” on a hand cart. Accused No.4 Anwar is his servant. The\\n“Anda Bhurji” stall falls exactly on the way which proceed towards the\\nhotel and house of the informant. The customers of “Anda Bhurji” stall of\\nthe accused were causing obstruction to the informant to use said road\\nfreely and openly. Therefore on 11.11.2010 at about 7.30 p.m. the\\ninformant asked the accused Jamir to shift his stall to some other place.\\nAccused Jamir did not say anything to the informant at that time.\\nHowever when his mother got to know the said fact she went to the house\\nof informant at about 11.30 p.m. and asked the informant as to why she\\nis asking her son to shift his stall to some other place. Therefore\\ninformant went to the accused Jamir and told him that his mother is\\nraising quarrel with her. On that he too got angry with her and made a\\nscuffle with her and gave a blow of fighter on her face. His servant\\naccused Anwar and brothers Sameer and Javed i.e. accused no.2 to 4\\nwere also present there and they also beaten her. Accused Javed was\\narmed with an iron pipe. When he was about to inflict the blow of iron3 R.C.C.No.229/2011\\npipe the brother\\xadin\\xadlaw of the informant namely Gulam intervened and\\ndue to that the said blow was received at the shoulder of informant.\\nThereafter some crowd gathered there and they shifted the informant to\\nthe hospital.\\n[3] After this incident when her husband Dastgir and mother\\xadin\\xad\\nlaw Jainuddin were coming to Bytco Hospital to see her they were also\\nbeaten up by the accused near State Bank of India. Therefore they were\\nalso admitted in Bytco Hospital at Nashik Road. While admitted in the\\nhospital she lodged report of incident with the police and on the said\\nreport crime bearing its registration No .751/2010 was registered against\\nthe accused for the offences punishable under section 324,323,504,506\\nread with section 34 of I.P.C. Police Head Constable A.N.Sayyad under\\n\\xadtook the investigation of offence and submitted charge sheet on\\ncompletion of it.\\n[4] Charge of the offence is framed against the accused vide\\nExh.67 and its contents were explained to him in vernacular. However the\\naccused pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial. Hence trial was held\\nagainst him.\\n[5] To further its case the prosecution has examined the\\ninformant Shakera as P.W.1 Exh.24, her brother\\xadin\\xadlaw Gulam as P.W.2\\nExh.26, her husband Shaikh Dastgir as P.W.3 Exh.27, her mother\\xadin\\xadlaw\\nJainubi Babulal Shaikh as P.W.4 Exh.28, Investigating Officer Police\\nHead Constable Sayyad as P.W.5 at Exh.30 and Medical Officer\\nDr.Ratnakar Pagare as P.W.6 Exh.374 R.C.C.No.229/2011\\n[6] Inorder to give an opportunity to the accused to explain the\\ncircumstances appearing against them in the evidence of prosecution their\\nstatement vide section 313 Cir.P.C. is recorded vide Exh.49 to 52.\\nAccused have taken the defence of total denial.\\n[7] I have heard learned A.P.P. Shri Kahane appearing on behalf\\nof the state and learned Advocate Shri V.K.Rao for the accused at great\\nlength.\\n[8] On going through the charge and the evidence adduced in\\nsupport of the charge, the following points arises for my determination on\\nwhich I recorded my findings with reasons as follows.\\nPoint Findings\\n1 Does the prosecution prove that\\non 11.11.2010 at about 23.30\\nhours at Gosaviwadi Nashik Road\\nTal.& Dist.Nashik the accused\\nno.1 to 4 in futherance of their\\ncommon intention voluntarily\\ncaused grievous hurt to the\\ncomplainant Shakera Dastgir\\nShaikh by means of fighter and\\niron pipe on her face if used as a\\nweapon of offence likely to cause\\ndeath also voluntarily caused\\nhurt to witnesses Gulam,Jainubi\\nand Dastgir Shaikh, intentionally\\ninsulted them gave them provocation\\nknowing or intending that such\\nprovocation would cause them\\nto break public peace, also committed\\ncriminal intimidation by threatening them5 R.C.C.No.229/2011\\nto cause injuries to their lives? No\\n2 What order? .. As per order below\\nR E A S O N S\\nAs to point No.1 and 2\\n[9] P.W.1 and 3 are the injured and therefore they are the\\nmaterial witnesses in the case. I have minutely perused the evidence of\\nboth of these witnesses. Initially they have stickup to their version that\\nthey were assaulted by the accused persons but during the cross\\nexamination they have totally turned back from their version and stated\\nthat the said version was deposed by them out of misunderstanding. In the\\ncross examination they have totally denied the occurrence and stated that\\nno such incident had occurred between themselves and the accused.\\nTherefore if the cross examination of these witnesses is taken in to\\nconsideration it does not establish from their evidence that they were\\nassaulted by the accused persons.\\n[10] P.W.2 and 4 are the eye witnesses. They have stated that the\\naccused had assaulted to P.W.1 and 3 in their presence. But much\\nimportance cannot be given to their evidence because basically P.W.1 and\\n2 have denied the truth of said incident. P.W.2 has stated that accused\\nJaved had inflicted the blow of iron rod on his left shoulder. But his\\nevidence does not get any corroboration from the evidence of other\\nwitnesses. On the contrary P.W.1 has stated that the blow of iron pipe\\nreceived by the P.W.3 was accidental in nature. As such there is no\\nconvincing evidence on the record to support the charge of offences\\nlevelled against the accused. P.W.5 is the panch witness on seizure6 R.C.C.No.229/2011\\npanchanama whereas P.W.6 is the Investigating Officer, but their evidence\\ndoes not needs to be discussed here as the main witnesses does not\\nsupport the charge. P.W.7 and P.W.8 are the panch witnesses on spot\\npanchanama, but they were turned hostile. Therefore their evidence also\\ndoes not need any discussion here.\\n[11] Inview of the above therefore I find no hesitance to hold that\\nprosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused beyond reasonable\\ndoubt. Consequently the accused are entitled to acquittal. Hence order.\\nO R D E R\\n1 The accused No.1 Jamir Ansar Sayyad, accused no.2 Sameer\\nAnsar Sayyad, accused no.3 Javed Ansar Sayyad and accused No.4 Anwar\\nHusain Rafique Mohammed are acquitted of the offence punishable\\nunder section 326,324,323,504,506 read with section 34 of I.P.C. vide\\nsection 248(1) of Cr.P.C.\\n2 The bail bond of accused shall continued for further period of six\\nmonths vide section 437\\xadA of Cr.P.C.\\n3 Muddemal property be destroyed after period of appeal is over.\\nDate:16\\xad05\\xad2014 (J.C.Dhengale)\\nNashik Road Judicial Magistrate,F.C.Jt.Court\\nNashik Road',\n",

On 26.10.2011 at about 8.30 p.m. near community temple\\nthe accused had beaten nephew of informant. Therefore informant went\\nto the accused Pappu to make inquiry as to why he had beaten up to his\\nnephew. However the accused got annoyed and with the help of other\\naccused persons he beaten up to informant. The accused had sythe and\\nwooden stick in their hands and they had inflicted blow of it on the head\\nof informant which caused bleeding injury to his head. Thereafter the\\naccused issued threats that they would kill one by one to family\\nmembers of the informant and ran away from there. After the incident one\\nSantosh Khune and Jagtap shifted the informant for medical treatment at\\nBytco Hospital and while admitted in the hospital the present report was\\nlodged by the informant against the accused. On the report lodged by the\\ninformant crime bearing CR No.318/2011 for the offences pus 324,504\\n506 r.w.s 34 and section 37 (1) r.we. 135 of Bombay Police Act came to3 R.C.C.No.21/2012\\nbe registered.

No\\n4 Does prosecution prove that the accused\\nno.1 to 4 have breacher order of Police\\nCommissioner Nashik duly promulgated\\nunder section 37(1) of the Bombay Police\\nAct bearing No. Desk\\xad10/SB/PO/6650/2011\\ndated 20\\xad10\\xad2011? No.\\n5 What order? .. As per order below\\nR E A S O N S\\nAs to point no.1 to 5\\n8 The informant Omprakash is the victim of offence and\\ntherefore he becomes an important witness do far as accusation levelled\\nagainst the accused is concerned. I have gone through his evidence. But it\\nis important to note that the informant has completely turned hostile to his\\nearlier version narrated by him in the report. The informant does not at all5 R.C.C.No.21/2012\\nsupport to the version narrated by him in the report. He has admitted the\\nsignature appended over the report, however denied the contents of it in\\ntoto. Informant has specifically stated in his evidence that there was\\nmerely petty quarrel between himself and accused and except that no\\nincident had taken place between himself and accused on 26.10\\xad.2011.\\nThus the informant has completely turned hostile and he does not at all\\nsupport the case of prosecution. Except the evidence of informant\\nevidence of no any other witnesses is available on the record. Thus the\\nprosecution has totally failed to prove the incident and the charge of the\\noffence framed against the accused.\\n9 In the absence of any substantial evidence on the record,\\ntherefore the charge of the offence shall not be proved against the accused\\nConsequently accused needs tobe acquitted.\\n10 Now let us see what section 37 of the Bombay Police Act\\nspeaks about. As per this section the Commissioner and the District\\nMagistrate in area under their respective charge may whenever and for\\nsuch time as they shall consider necessary for the preservation of public\\npeace or safety by notification publically promulgated or addressed to\\nindividual prohibit at any town village or place or in the vicinity of any\\nsuch town village or place the carrying of among the other arms including\\nthe sword. So here also the promulgation and publication f notification of\\nCommissioner or D.M. is must . Prosecution has produced the said\\nnotification on the record. But there is no evidence on the record to show\\nthat the said notification was duly promulgated in the public. It is not the\\ncase of prosecution that this notification was individually addressed to the6 R.C.C.No.21/2012\\naccused persons. The purpose of publication of notification is generally to\\nbring the particular matter to the notice of public and therefore unless the\\nmatter is brought to the notice of public by publication advertisement it\\ncannot amount to promulgation or publication. Therefore it was very\\nmuch necessary on the part of prosecution to prove publication and\\npromulgation of this notification. But as stated above the prosecution has\\nno evidence to show that the above notification was promulgated and the\\naccused had knowledge of it. Therefore for want of evidence regarding\\npromulgation and publication of notification the accusation u/s 37 of\\nBombay Police Act against the accused. also shall not be tenable at law\\n11 In the absence of any substantial evidence on the record,\\ntherefore the charge of the offence shall not be proved against the accused\\nConsequently accused needs to be acquitted. Hence I answer point no 1 to\\n5 against the prosecution and proceed to pass the following order.\\nO R D E R\\n1 The accused No 1 Pappu Prakash More, accused no.2 Sanjay\\nLaxman Mali, accused no.3 Sunil Ramesh More and accused no.4\\nNavnath Vishnu More are acquitted of the offence punishable under\\nsection 324,504,506 of I.P.C. and section 135 of the Bombay Police Act\\nvide section 248(1) of Cr.P.C.\\n2 The bail bonds of accused shall continued for further period\\nof six months vide section 437\\xadA of Cr.P.C.\\nDate:26\\xad02\\xad2014 (J.C.Dhengale)\\nNashik Road Judicial Magistrate,F.C.

The prosecution case, in brief, is as follows;\\nThe incident occured on 25.12.2008, at about 1.30 p.m at the\\nhouse of the informant at Kadam chaul Sadgurunagar no. 3 Dasaak, Jail\\nRoad, Nashik Road.

The defence of accused was that of total denial. The\\nstatements against accused u/s. 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure is\\nrecorded vide Exh.52\\n9. Heard Ld. A.P.P. and Ld. Adv. for accused Considering the\\nabove evidence and arguments advanced by both the sides, following\\npoints arise for determination and I have recorded my findings thereon\\nwith reasons as under.\\nSr.No Points Findings\\n1. Does prosecution prove that on 25.12.2008, at In the\\nabout 1.30 p.m at the house of the informant at negative\\nKadamchaul Sadgurunagar No.3Dasaak, Jail\\nRoad, Nashik Road accused committed house\\ntrespass by entering into the house of informant\\nhaving made preparation for causing hurt to her\\nand outrage her modesty?10\\n2. Does prosecution prove that accused on above date In the\\n, time and place accused assaulted informant negative\\nintending to outrage the modesty of the informant\\nby such assault and thereby committed an offence\\npunishable under section 354 r/w 34 of IPC ?\\n3. Does prosecution prove that accused on above date In the\\n, time and place accused voluntarily caused hurt to negative\\nthe informant and thereby committed an offence\\npunishable under section 323 r/w 34 of IPC ?\\n4. What order ? As per final\\norder\\nR E A S O N S\\nAs to Point No.1 to 3:\\n10. These points are interlinked with each other and in order to\\navoid repetition they are taken together for discussion. Learned APP for\\nthe state argued that, the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt\\nthat the accused committed house trespass by entering into the house of\\ninformant, having made preparation for causing hurt to her and outrage\\nher modesty. The informant was assaulted by the accused and the accused\\nintended to outrage her modesty or knew that her modesty was likely to\\nbe outraged. He submitted that prosecution witnesses no. 2 though not\\neye witness to the incident however he supported in material particulars\\nof versions of p.w. no. 1 that accused called him on telephone and\\ninquired him about his location. Apart from that P.W.3 who is\\ninvestigating officer specifically stated that during investigation it reveals\\nthat accused has committed an offence. He further submitted that though\\ndelay is occurs in lodging the F.I.R. but it is satisfactorily explained by\\nthe prosecution. The spot panchnama is admitted on behalf of the5 R.C.C No.115/2009 judgment Exh.45\\naccused. The sole testimony of informant is sufficient for conviction of\\naccused. The offences punishable under section 452,354, 323 of Indian\\nPenal Code proved against accused. Therefore the maximum sentences\\nbe awarded to the accused.\\n11. Per contra learned Adv. Pradhan for the accused vehemently\\nargued that, prior to lodging the report for commission of offences\\npunishable under section 452, 354, 323 of Indian Penal Code, the\\ninformant has filed reports on 24/12/2008 and 25/12/2008. On\\n25/12/2008, informant has lodged report only as the accused and along\\nwith unknown person came in front of her house. They beat and abused\\nher. The informant has again filed complaint at police station on\\n17/1/2009 with alleged incident dated 25/12/2008. On the alleged\\nincident she went to the police station along with her husband. However\\nshe has not stated that accused assaulted her or criminal force was used\\nto her by the accused and the accused intended to outrage her\\nmodesty. This story of prosecution is not believable. As accused and\\ninformant are neighbour and they are not having good terms, Therefore\\nthis case came to be lodged against the accused in order to harass him. He\\nfurther more argued that, the prosecution utterly failed to prove its case,\\nhence the accused deserves to be acquitted.\\n12. In the light of rival submissions of prosecution and defence,\\nevidence came on record is to be assessed. In order to prove the guilt of\\nthe accused u/s 452,354,323 of IPC, prosecution has to prove following\\ningredients:\\n(1) The accused committed house trespass by entering into the house of\\ninformant , having made preparation for causing hurt to her and outrage10\\nher modesty.\\n(2) A informant was assaulted or criminal force was used to her\\n(3) The assault or use of criminal force was by the accused.\\n(4)The accused intended to outrage her modesty or knew tha her modesty\\nwas likely to be outraged.\\n(5) The accused caused bodily pain to the informant with intention to\\ncausing hurt.\\n13. In this regard the prosecution has examined informant at\\nExh.21. At the inception she deposed about incident occurred on\\n24/12/2008.She deposed that on that day some dispute was taken place\\nbetween accused wife and Sau.Kharat due to water. When she was talking\\nwith Sau.Kharat,accused started to abused her due to misunderstanding.\\nThe accused and his wife beat her. After that she has lodged report on\\n24/12/2014 against them which is at Ex.25.Informant deposed that on\\n25/12/2008 at about 1.30p.m. accused with drunken condition came at\\nher house. He inquired her husband on telephone about his location. She\\ndeposed that on seeing that she was alone at her house,accused slapped\\nher and pulled her on bed.He torn her blows by saying that now I will\\nrape you. Informant deposed that she pushed accused and came outside\\nthe house. On same date she has lodged complaint against the accused\\nwhich is at Ex.27, However police have not taken any action against the\\naccused,Therefore again she went to the police station and lodged the\\nreport which is at Exh. 28. She was cross examined by ld. Advocate for\\naccused. In cross examination she has deposed that in 25/12/2008 she has\\nstated entire incident to the police and they have write down it. She has\\nstated that without reading it she has signed over it as she was not in\\nproper condition. She has stated that on same day again she has went to\\nthe police station along with her husband.7 R.C.C No.115/2009 judgment Exh.45\\n14. The prosecution has examined PW 2 Anil at Ex.36 who is\\nhusband of the informant. He deposed that on 25/12/2008 accused called\\nhim and asked his location. On same day near about 4 to 5 O' clock he\\nreturned to home , at that time informant told him the incident. He\\ndeposed that informant told about about assault by the accused with\\nintention to outrage her modesty. She has lodged the report at police\\nstation. At evening they again went to the police station. The police have\\nrecorded his statement. This witness is not a eye witness in this case.\\nDuring his cross examination he has stated that on 25/12/2008, police\\nhave write down the incident stated to them by him and the informant. On\\nthat day he was present along with the informant. He has stated that he\\nhas narrated to the police that on that day he went for rick\\xadshow driving\\nand accused called him and asked him about his location. He can not tell\\nthe reason why this portion is not in his statement.\\n15. The prosecution has examine P.W.3. PHC P.S.Sapkale who is\\ninvestigating officer in this case. He deposed that on 17/01/2009 he was\\nattached to Jail road Police Station which is under Nashik road police\\nstation. The investigation in crime no.37/2009 was allotted to him along\\nwith report at Ex.28.Then he went to the spot and effected spot\\npanchnama presence of panchas which is at Ex.37.He has recorded the\\nstatement of witnesses. He has filed charge sheet in the court as during\\ninvestigation it reveals that accused has committed a crime. During his\\ncross examination he stated that he ahs not recovered any thing from\\nspot. He has denied all successions put to him during cross examination.\\n16. Now important aspect which needs to consider as to delay in\\nlodging report. It has came on record that in total 3 reports filed by the10\\ninformant against the accused.\\n1. Firstly report filed on 24/12/2008 that, on same day accused\\nand her wife beat and abuse her.\\n2. Secondly report filed on 25/12/2008 that on same date accused\\nand one Pankaj again beat, abuse her. They also threats her.\\n3. Thirdly report filed on 17/01/2009 that on 25/12/2008, accused\\nassaulted informant or criminal force was used to her by the\\naccused with intention to outrage her modesty.\\n17. The important piece of document is copy of the second\\nreport filed by the informant dated 25/12/2008 is at Ex.27. She has lodged\\nreport against accused and one Pankaj alleging that they came infront of\\nher house with drunken condition. They beat and abuse her. They also\\nthreat her. The informant was went to police station along with her\\nhusband and this report was signed by informant. It is pertinent to note on\\n25/12/2008 she went to the police station, however she has not filed\\nreport as accused assaulted her or criminal force was used to her by the\\naccused and also the accused intended to outrage her modesty, However\\nshe has lodged report at police station on 17/01/2009 regarding incident\\noccurred on 25/12/2008 stating that accused assaulted her or criminal\\nforce was used to her by the accused with intention to outrage her\\nmodesty. The explanation given by the prosecution that as police have not\\ntaken any action against accused, hence informant has filed report again\\non 17/01/2009. It is well settled that the delay in lodging the FIR\\nquestion is concerned, the delay in a case of sexual assault, cannot be\\nequated with the case involving other offences. There are several factors9 R.C.C No.115/2009 judgment Exh.45\\nwhich weigh in the mind of the informant and her family members before\\ncoming to the police station to lodge a report. However in the present\\ncase it has came on record that informant went to the police station along\\nwith her husband. The report dated 25/12/2008 was signed by informant.\\nIn that report another person Pankaj is shown to be present along with\\naccused, and incident occurred in front of house of informant at 2.00 p.m.\\nIn my opinion the explanation is not satisfactory when report dated\\n25/12/2008 was sign by the informant.\\n18. Considering this aspect the evidence of prosecution witnesses\\nis not at all trustworthy. In the result accused is entitled for benefit of\\ndoubt. As prosecution fails to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.\\nHence I answer point no. 1 to 3 are in the negative and in reply to Point\\nNo. 4, I pass the following order.\\nORDER\\n1) Accused is hereby acquitted of he offence punishable under\\nsection 452,354, 323 of Indian Penal Code vide Section 248(1)\\nof Criminal Procedure Code.\\n2) His bail bond stands cancelled.\\n3) Pronounced in Open Court.\\nDate:28.02.2014 (Ashish D.

P.C.\\n2 In short the case of prosecution may be stated as under\\nLaw was set into motion on the report of one Vinod Dada\\nBhalerao. On 19.2.2012 at about 10.00 p.m. the informant and his brother\\nPramod were standing near Maldhakka square at Rajwada Deolaligaon\\nchatting with each other. At that time accused arrived there and struck the\\nissue of Municipal Corporation and raised quarrel with them on that\\ncount. Accused were abusing them. Informant tried to pacify them. But\\nthe accused Sagar who was armed with wooden stick, inflicted the blow\\nof it on his head and thereby caused bleeding injury to him. The other\\naccused gave slaps to the informant. After this incident his brother\\nPramod shifted him to the Bytco Hospital for medical treatment. After\\ntaking the medical treatment he went to police station along with medical\\ncertificate and lodged report of the incident with the police. On the basis\\nof this report police registered crime No.69/12 against the accused for\\noffences punishable under section 324,33,504,506 read with section 34 of\\nthe Indian Penal Code. Police Head Constable Baburao Bhusare under\\ntook the investigation and charge sheeted the accused for the aforesaid\\noffences.\\n3 During pendency of trial accused no.2 Raju Sitaram Bhalerao is\\nreported to be dead. Hence case was abated against him.3 R.C.C.No.225/2012\\n4 At the conclusion of investigation charge vide Exh.18 was\\nframed against the accused No.1,3 and 4 and its contents were explained\\nto them in vernacular. However the accused pleaded not guilty and\\nclaimed for trial. Hence trial was held against them.\\n5 To further its case the prosecution has examined informant\\nVinod as P.W.1 Exh.23, panch on spot panchanama Ragini Donde as\\nP.W.2 Exh.25, investigating Officer Police Head Constable Shri\\nB.L.Bhusare as P.W.3 Exh.27, alleged eye witness Surekha Jadhav as\\nP.W.4 Exh.29 and Medical Officer Dr. Kanchan Lokwani as P.W.6\\nExh.31.\\n6 Inorder to give an opportunity to the accused to explain the\\ncircumstances appearing against him in the evidence of prosecution their\\nstatements vide section 313 Cr.P.C. are recorded vide Exh.39 to 41\\nAccused have taken the defence of total denial.\\n7 I have heard learned A.P.P. Shri Kahame appearing on behalf\\nof the state and learned Advocate Shri A.C.Pradhan for the accused at\\ngreat length.\\n8 On going through the charge and the evidence adduced in\\nsupport of the charge, the following points arises for my determination on\\nwhich I recorded my findings with reasons as follows.4 R.C.C.No.225/2012\\nPoint Findings\\n1 Does the prosecution prove that on\\n19.02.2012 at about 22.00 hours at\\nDeolaligaon Rajwada Nashik road\\naccused infurtherence of their common\\nintention voluntarily caused hurt to the\\ninformant on his head by means of stick\\nif used as a weapon of offence likely\\nto cause death? No\\n2 Does prosecution prove that accused\\non the aforesaid day,date,time and spot\\naccused infurtherence of their common\\nintention voluntarily caused hurt to the\\ninformant? No\\n3 Does prosecution prove that during\\nthe aforesaid day,date,time and spot the\\naccused infurtherence of their common\\nintention intentionally insulted the\\ninformant gave him provocation knowing\\nor intending that such provocation would\\ncause him to break public peace or to\\ncommit any cognizable offence ? No\\n4 Does prosecution prove that on the\\nafroesaid day date time and spot accused\\ninfurtherence of their common intention\\ncommitted criminal intimidation by\\nthreatening the informant Vinod to\\ncause injury to his life? No\\n5 What order? .. As per order below\\nR E A S O N S\\nAs to point No.1 to 5\\n9 Informant Vinod has sworn to the fact that on 02.03.2012\\npetty quarrel took place between his ender brother Pramod and the5 R.C.C.No.225/2012\\naccused persons. After this incident at about 9.00 p.m. to 9.30\\np.m.accused came to him and assaulted him by means of iron rod and\\nthereby caused bleeding injury to his head. However subsequently he\\nretracted his version on date of incident and stated that he won't be able to\\nstate the exact date of the incident. As per the report the incident had\\noccurred on 19.3.2012. Informant state that after the incident he was taken\\nto the hospital by the people gathered around the spot and that police\\nmade visit to the hospital and recorded his statement. He further state that\\non 02.03.2012 he again went to the police station and lodged the report\\nvide Exh.24.\\n10 If the cross examination of the informant is perused it can be\\nseen that he has not remained consistent with his earlier version deposed\\nby him in examination\\xadin\\xadchief. On every stage of the cross examination\\nhe has changed his earlier version in the chief examination and thus\\nseveral contradictions are noted in the evidence of informant. Firstly it\\nbecomes doubtful from the evidence of informant that his brother\\nPramod was present at the spot of incident. It is specifically mentioned\\nin the report vide Exh.24 that he was present at the spot of incident along\\nwith informant. But informant has not stated any where in his evidence\\nthat his brother Pramod was also present with him at the time of\\noccurrence. On the contrary he has stated that after the incident the\\npeople gathered around the spot of incident had taken him to the hospital\\nand not by his brother as mentioned in the report. Again he has changed\\nhis version in the cross examination and stated that he was taken to the\\nhospital by his brother Pramod. So far as the report vide Exh.24 is\\nconcerned even in that regard also the evidence of informant is not6 R.C.C.No.225/2012\\nconsistent enough. Because as stated earlier he has clearly stated that\\nimmediately after the incident he had lodged the report of incident with\\nthe police. So obviously the report lodged by him on 02.3.2012 would be\\nthe second report. It was necessary on the part of prosecution to explain\\nthese ambiguities by taking explanation to that effect from the\\nInvestigating Officer in his evidence. Evidence of Investigating Officer is\\nrecorded below Exh.27. But the evidence of Investigating Officer is also\\nsilent on this point. Thus this ambiguity of two reports has remained as it\\nis on the record. So the question would arise as to what as the first report\\nand why it was not placed on the record. Secondly, the so called report\\nvide Exh.24 lodged by the informant cannot be considered to be the first\\nreport and certainly it creates doubt about its genuineness also.\\n11 Apart this it can be seen from the evidence of the informant\\nthat the story that he was beaten by the accused by iron rod has come\\nbefore the Court for first time in his evidence and it does not get any\\ncorroboration from the so called report vide Exh.24. Because it is no\\nwhere mentioned in the said report that the informant was assaulted by\\nthe accused by means of iron rod. In the report it is mentioned that only\\nthe accused Sagar had inflicted the blow of wooden stick on the head of\\ninformant and rest of the accused had merely gave slaps to him. It is no\\nwhere stated in the report that the accused were armed with iron rod as\\nstated by the informant in the evidence or that inflicted the blow of iron\\nrod on his head. It is important to note that P.W.4 is the only eye witness\\navailable with the prosecution. But she also does not support to the case\\nof prosecution. Therefore the case of prosecution is totally depending\\nupon the evidence of informant, Investigating Officer P.W.3 and Medical7 R.C.C.No.225/2012\\nOfficer P.W.5. Admittedly P.W.3 and 5 are not eye witnesses of the\\nincident. Their evidence would get the value only if the evidence of\\ninformant is found to be trustworthy and reliable. But as stated above the\\nevidence of informant is full of contradictions. There are material\\ncontradictions in his evidence regarding the occurrence as well as the\\nweapon used in the commission of the offence. No doubt P.W.5 i.e.\\nMedical Officer had found injuries on the head of the informant. P.W.5\\nhas stated that informant had sustained bleeding injury on head with\\nC.L.W. 2 x 0.5 x 0.5 c.m. on occipital region with active bleeding present\\nand the medico\\xadlegal certificate below Exh.32 was duly proved in her\\nevidence. But from the evidence of this witness it shall not be proved that\\nthe said injuries were caused by the accused. Therefore though the\\nevidence of P.W.5 or the evidence of Investigating Officer lay\\ncorroboration to the evidence of informant however much value cannot be\\nattached to their evidence in the light of contradictions arose in the\\nevidence of informant regarding the occurrence and weapon used in the\\ncommission of offence. Because the evidence of informant itself does not\\nfind to be trustworthy and reliable.\\n12 Thus there is no direct or incriminating evidence against the\\naccused showing their involvement in the commission of offence. The\\nrecovery of alleged weapon or the spot of the incident is also not proved.\\n13 Inview of the discussion therefore I find no hesitance to hold\\nthat the prosecution has miserably failed to prove guilt of accused beyond\\nreasonable doubt. Consequently accused becomes entitled for the\\nacquittal. Hence I answer point nos 1 to 4 against the prosecution and in8 R.C.C.No.225/2012\\nanswer to point no.5 proceed to pass the following order.\\nO R D E R\\n1 The accused No.1 Sagar Raju Bhalerao, accused no.3 Kailash\\nSitaram Bhalerao, accused no.4 Bharat Sitaram Bhalerao are acquitted of\\nthe offence punishable under section 324,323,504,506 read with\\nsection 34 of I.P.C. vide section 248(1) of Cr.P.C.\\n2 The accused no.2 Raju Sitaram Bhalerao is reported to be\\ndead hence case is abated against him.\\n3 The bail bond of accused shall continued for further period\\nof six months vide section 437\\xadA of Cr.P.C.\\n4 Seized muddemal i.e. one stick being worthless be destroyed\\nafter period of appeal is over.\\nDate:31\\xad07\\xad2014 (J.C.Dhengale)\\nNashik Road Judicial Magistrate,F.C Jt Court\\nNashik Road\",\n",

Senior Civil Judge &\\nCJM, Dharwad., inpursuance of which, suit of the plaintiffs for seeking3 RA No.31/2013\\npartition against the defendants came to be partly decreed without\\nallotting any share to appellant/plaintiff No.4 and further allotting only\\nshares in half of the house property to plaintiffs No.1 to 3. It is stated in\\nappeal memo that after partly decreeing the suit in the trial court the\\nplaintiff No.1 died on 08.06.2012 by leaving behind him his legal\\nrepresentatives who are already on record as plaintiff No.2 to 4 and\\ndefendant No.1 i.e. Respondent No.6, 7 and appellant and respondent\\nNo.1\\n2. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be referred in this\\nappeal on the basis of their ranking in the trial court.\\n3. The brief facts as averred in the Appeal Memo are as under:\\nThe plaintiffs filed suit against the defendants seeking relief of\\npartition and separate possession in respect of the suit schedule\\nproperties. Among suit properties, property at S.No.1 is land bearing\\nR.S.No. 180 measuring 26 guntas situated at Hosayallapur, Dharwad\\nwas granted to the father of the defendants 1 and 2 by the Land Tribunal,\\nDharwad and after grant of occupancy rights, father of the defendants 1\\nand 2 was in possession and enjoyment of the same till his death and\\nafter the death of father of the defendant No.1 and 2, oral partition taken\\nplace between defendants 1 and 2 and in the said oral partition 12 guntas\\nland was allotted to defendants 1 and 14 guntas of land was allotted to\\ndefendant No.2 and accordingly, the Revenue Entries were effected in\\nthe Mutation Register. The House Property bearing CTS No. 624\\nsituated at Hosayallapur, Dharwad was fallen to the share of defendant\\nNo.1 and House property bearing C.T.S. No.625 in oral partition4 RA No.31/2013\\nbetween the defendants 1 and 2. Defendant No.1 is addicted to bad\\nhabits and he was trying to alienate the suit properties stated supra and\\ntherefore, plaintiffs demanded their respective shares in the suit\\nproperties, but defendant No.1 refused to comply with their demand.\\n4. After registering the suit, in the trial court after having received\\nsummons, defendant No.1 appeared and filed hi written statement\\ndenied the plaintiffs case and further contended that plaintiff No.4 at the\\ninstigation of ill wisher of the defendant No.1 the suit has been filed. The\\ndefendant No.2 though appeared but not engaged any Advocate and not\\nfiled his written statement. Further trial court record disclose that\\npending the suit defendant No.2 died and his LRs brought on record and\\nLrs of defendant No.2 also engaged same Advocate to whom defendant\\nNo.1 engaged. Even LRs of defendant No.2 also not filed written\\nstatement.\\n5. On the basis of said pleadings of both parties, trial Court framed\\nthe following issues.\\n1) Whether the plaintiffs prove that themselves and first\\ndefendant are the members of Hindu Joint Family and are in\\njoint possession of schedule property at Sl.No.1?\\n2) Whether the plaintiffs prove that the schedule properties\\nare the joint family properties of themselves and defendant?\\n3) Whether the plaintiffs prove that the 1st defendant has\\nbeen trying to alienate the suit schedule property?\\n4) Are the plaintiffs entitled for 1/5th share in the suit\\nschedule property and separate possession thereof?\\n5) What order or decree?5 RA No.31/2013\\n6. Plaintiffs in order to prove their case in trial court got examined\\nplaintiff No.4 as P.W.1 and got marked relevant documents. But,\\ndefendants did not adduce any evidence on their behalf.\\n7. The Trial Court held that the plaintiff No.1 to 3 are entitled to get\\n1/4th share in 12 guntas of land bearing Sy. No.180 and 1/4th share in ½\\nportion of the CTS No.624. Being aggrieved by the same, plaintiff No.4\\npreferred this appeal on the following grounds:\\n(a) The Judgment and Decree of the trial court is\\nperverse and contrary to law.\\n(b) The trial court has gravely erred in appreciating\\nthe pleadings, facts and evidence on record.\\n(c) The trial court ought to have decreed the suit of\\nthe plaintiffs in its entirety.\\n(d) The trial court has denied the share of the plaintiff\\nNo.4 who is mother of plaintiffs 1 to 3 without any\\nlegal justification.\\n(e) The trial court has failed to appreciate the law\\ngoverning to Hindu Joint Families.\\n(f) The trial court has wrongly allotted shares to\\nplaintiffs in respect of the half of suit house property\\nbut in fact in the entire house property shares ought to\\nhave allotted to the plaintiffs.6 RA No.31/2013\\n(g) The trial court has ignored the pleadings to the\\neffect that the husband of respondent No.2 has\\nalready been awarded CTS No.625.\\n(h) The trial court has failed to appreciate the law laid\\ndown in Mitakshara School of Law.\\n(i) The trial court ought to have granted 1/4th share to\\nthe appellant in suit properties but it has not done so.\\nTherefore, the judgment hand decree of the trial court\\nis bad in law.\\nOn these grounds, the appellant prayed for setting aside the\\nimpugned Judgment and Decree passed by the Prl. Civil Judge,\\nDharwad on 09.01.2012 in O.S.No.94/2009. It is pertinent to note here\\nthat the appellant/ plaintiff No.4 got amended the plaint in this appeal in\\nrespect of C.T.S. No. of property allotted to defendant No.2 and in\\nrespect of boundaries of suit land allotted to defendant No.1 in oral\\npartition between defendant No.1 and defendant No.2.\\n8. Heard the arguments and perused the records.\\n9. The points that arise for my consideration and determination are\\nas under:\\n1. Whether trial Court committed error in not\\nawarding share to the plaintiff No.4/appellant in the\\nsuit schedule properties ?\\n2. Whether trial Court committed error by awarding\\nplaintiff No.1 to 3’s share only in half portion in the\\nsuit house property ?7 RA No.31/2013\\n3. Whether trial Court judgment and decree\\ndeserves to be set aside ?\\n4. What order?\\n10. My answers to the above said points are as under:\\nPoint No.1 : In the affirmative.\\nPoint No.2 : In the affirmative.\\nPoint No.3 : In the affirmative.\\nPoint No.4 : As per final order for the following:\\nR E A S O N S\\n11. POINT No.1 to 3 : I have taken all these points together to\\navoid repetition of reasoning. Admittedly plaintiff No.4 along with\\nplaintiff No.1 to 3 filed suit for seeking partition and separate\\npossession in respect of suit schedule properties against defendant\\nNo.1 who happens to be father of plaintiff No.1 to 3 and husband of\\nplaintiff No.4. It is an undisputed fact that the suit properties are joint\\nfamily properties of plaintiffs and defendant No.1 and suit properties\\nhave been fallen to the share of defendant No.1 in oral partition taken\\nplace between defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 after the death of\\ntheir father since the oral evidence of P.W.1 to this effect has not been\\ndenied by defendant No.1. Further the evidence of P.W1 to this effect\\nto some extent is corroborated by documentary evidence also like\\nEx.P1 R.O.R of the suit land. Further it is an undisputed fact that house\\nproperty bearing CTS No.624 has been allotted to the share of8 RA No.31/2013\\ndefendant No.1 and CTS No.625 has been allotted to the share of\\ndefendant No.2 in the partition taken place between defendant No.1\\nand 2. It is necessary to note here that Advocate for respondent No.2\\nto 5 who are LRs of defendant No.2 has filed memo dated 28.3.2014\\nstating that respondents No.2 to 5 have no any claim in respect of\\nproperty bearing C.T.S.624 that is suit house property. It is an\\nundisputed fact that plaintiffs and defendant No.1 are members of\\nHindu joint family consisting plaintiffs and defendant No.1 and no\\npartition has taken place between plaintiffs and defendant No.1 in\\nrespect of suit schedule properties since defendant No.1 and 2 not\\ndenied the evidence of P.W.1 in cross examination. The evidence of\\nP.W.1 is remained unchallenged. Further it is an undisputed fact that\\nthe plaintiffs and defendant No.1 belongs to Hindus and they are\\ngoverned by Mitakshara School of law. So, naturally if partition taken\\nplace between plaintiffs No.1 to 3 who happens to be children of\\ndefendant No.1 and plaintiff No.4, automatically plaintiff No.4 is also\\nentitle to get equal share along with her children. In a case reported in\\nILR 1998 Kar 2067 (Umakant Rao Vs. Lalita Bai) it has been held and\\nobserved in para 29 of the judgment that under general Hindu law, a\\nHindu wife herself cannot seek partition. But if a partition takes place\\nbetween her husband and his son, she is entitle to get equal share and9 RA No.31/2013\\nenjoy the same separately even from her husband. Further admittedly\\nparties in this case are from old Bombay- Karnataka area and they are\\nnot from old Hyderabad-Karnataka area. So, looking to the proposition\\nof law laid down in the said decision as well as looking to the facts and\\ncircumstances of the case on record, I am of the considered opinion\\nthat plaintiff No.4 being wife of defendant No.1 and mother of plaintiff\\nNo.1 to 3, is also entitle to get equal share in the suit properties since\\npartition is being taken place between plaintiff No.1 to 3 and defendant\\nNo.1. Therefore by not awarding the share to plaintiff No.4 in the suit\\nschedule properties, the trial Court has committed an error apparent on\\nthe record. Further admittedly the suit house property bearing CTS\\nNo.624 has been allotted exclusively to defendant No.1 in oral partition\\ntaken place between defendant No.1 and his brother defendant No.2.\\nTherefore all plaintiffs and defendant No.1 equally entitle to get their\\nshare in the entire suit house property. But the trial Court in impugned\\njudgment and decree has awarded 1/4th share each to plaintiff No.1 to\\n3 only in half of the suit house thinking that defendant No.2, brother of\\ndefendant No.2 is also having half share in it.\\n12. Further after passing judgment and decree of trial Court the as\\nalready stated supra plaintiff No.1 died on 8.6.2012 by leaving behind\\nhis legal representatives who are already on record as plaintiff No.2 to1 0 RA No.31/2013\\n4 and defendant No.1 since plaintiff No.1 died un-married. Advocate for\\nappellant produced death extract of plaintiff No.1 by filing memo.\\nTherefore the plaintiff No.2 to 4 and defendant No.1 being L.Rs. of the\\ndefendant No.1 are equally entitle to get share of the plaintiff No.1 in\\nthe suit properties. Therefore plaintiff No.2 to 4 and defendant No.1\\neach entitle to get 1/4th share in the suit schedule properties by way of\\npartition and separate possession. Therefore considering all these\\nfacts I am of the considered opinion that the trial Court judgment and\\ndecree deserves to be set aside. Hence I answered point No.1 to 3 in\\nthe affirmative.\\n13. Point No.4: In view of my answer on point No.1 to 3 and for\\nthe foregoing reasons appeal has to be allowed and plaintiffs suit had\\nto be decreed by awarding share to plaintiff No.4 also and by awarding\\nequal share in the suit house property also. In the result, I proceed to\\npass the following,\\nO R D E R\\nAppeal is allowed.\\nThe impugned judgment and decree in O.S.No.94/2009 dated\\n9.1.2012 passed by Principal Senior Civil Judge, Dharwad is hereby set\\naside and plaintiffs’ suit is decreed.1 1 RA No.31/2013\\nPlaintiffs No.2 to 4 are entitled to get each 1/4th share in the suit\\nschedule properties by way of partition and separate possession by\\nmetes and bounds.\\nNo order as to costs.\\nDraw preliminary decree accordingly.\\nOffice is directed to send back the trial Court records forthwith\\nalong with copy of this judgment.\\n(Dictated to the Stenographer, transcribed and typed by her, corrected, signed and then\\npronounced by me in the open Court on this 29th day of March 2014).\\n(V.M.

Facts in brief are:\\nThe plaintiff submits that he is the absolute owner of non\\nagricultural plots No. 10, 11, 12 and 13 measuring 1 gunta and 12.25\\nanas, 1 gunta 13 anas, 1 gunta 6.25 anas and 1 guntas 7.5 anas\\nrespectively, of R.S.

The defendants are raising illegal structure without leaving\\nthe necessary set back or approval of HDMC. Hence, the present suit.\\n3. In pursuance to the suit summons defendants have appeared and\\nhave filed their Written Statement denying the averments made in the\\nplaint. It is contended that after obtaining necessary permission from the\\nHDMC they have undertaken construction over the suit property. There\\nis no violation of building by laws. The defendants have not interfered\\nwith the property belonging to the plaintiff. Hence, prayed to dismiss\\nthe suit.3 O.S. No. 158/07\\n4. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties the following issues\\nhave been framed:\\n1. Whether the plaintiff proves that the defendants\\ntrust is raising illegal structure in the suit schedule\\nproperty without having the necessary setback area?\\n2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the relief of\\npermanent injunction as prayed for?\\n3. What order or decree?\\n5. The plaintiff has examined himself as P.W.1 and has got marked\\nat Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.18 on his behalf. The Defendants have not led their\\nevidence. Evidence was closed.\\n6. Heard the arguments advanced.\\n7. My findings on the above issues are as under:\\nIssue No.1 : In the Negative\\nIssue No.2 : In the Negative.\\nAddl. Issue No.1 : In the Negative.\\nIssue No.3 : As per final order,\\nfor the following:\\nR E A S O N S\\n8. Issue Nos.1, 2 & Addl.Issue No.1 : Since these issues are interlinked\\nthey are taken up together for common discussion in order to avoid\\nrepetition of facts.4 O.S. No. 158/07\\nThe suit properties is agricultural land bearing 3/8 B measuring\\n30 guntas 8 anas situated at Doddanayakanakoppa, Sadhanakeri,\\nDharwad. The suit property is described in the sketch apprehended\\nwith the plaint as ABCD. PW 1 has adduced his evidence has\\nreiterated the averments made in the plaint in her affidavit in-verbatim.\\nHe has produced the following documents in support of his case which\\nis as follows: Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.5 are the property extracts pertaining to\\nR.S. No. 3D/10, 3D/11, 3D/12, 3D/13, 3/8- B. Ex.P. 6 to Ex.P. 8 are the\\napplications given by the plaintiff to the HDMC Dharwad and HDUDA\\nasserting ill construction over the suit property. Ex.P.8 is the application\\ngiven to the Tahashildar, Dharwad. Ex.P.9 is application given to\\nDeputy Commissioner, Dharwad asserting in ill construction over the\\nsuit property. Ex.P.10 is the letter addressed by the HDMC through\\nTahashildar. Ex.P.11 to Ex.P.14 are the photographs showing the suit\\nproperties. Ex.P.15 is the letter addressed by the Tahashildar Dharwad\\nto the plaintiff dated: 25/5/2007. Ex.P. 16 is the letter addressed by the\\nDeputy Commissioner Dharwad to HDUDA and HDMC Dharwad.\\nEx.P.17 is the letter addressed by the commissioner HDUDA to the\\ndefendant No.1, Ex.P.18 is the letter addressed by HDUDA Hubli to the\\nDeputy Commissioner, Dharwad. PW 1 has not been cross-examined\\nby the defendant. The evidence of P.W.1 goes unchallenged. During\\nthe course of the proceedings by virtue of the order passed on I.A.No.9,\\nADLR Dharwad was appoint to court commissioner to measure the\\nproperty of the plaintiff and the defendant and accordingly on 26/7/13.\\nThe commissioner report is submitted on 26/10/13 the court\\ncommissioner report has been accepted by this court. There is no\\nevidence of the defendant on record in support of his contentions.\\n9. Such being the state of affairs in this case this court is required to\\ngive its findings on the available records. On one hand there is a5 O.S. No. 158/07\\nevidence of P.W.1 and Ex.P. 1 to Ex.P.18 supporting the case of the\\nplaintiff and on the contrary there is the report of the court commissioner\\ndated: 26/7/2013 which is at variance with the evidence of P.W.1. The\\ndefendant herein has not adduced his evidence as mentioned earlier.\\nThe burden is heavily casted upon the plaintiff to prove the illegal\\nconstruction and the alleged disturbance caused to the people in the\\nvicinity because of the act of the defendant who is running a school. On\\nthe careful perusal of the report submitted by the court commissioner\\ndated: 26/7/2013 it is evident that there is no encroachment whatsoever\\nin respect of the suit property and also there is no violation of municipal\\nlaws by the defendant. Ex.P. 6 to Ex.P.18 is the letter correspondence\\nmade by the plaintiff and the authorities and nothing much can be of\\nassistance to through light over the matter as to when the\\ncorrespondence is made. From the available evidence on the record, I\\nam of the considered view that the evidence of the plaintiff is insufficient\\nto come to the conclusion that the defendant has violated the municipal\\nlaws and is causing disturbance to the people living in the vicinity. More\\nover the present suit is not representative suit. The effect or the\\ninterested people of the vicinity are not made parties to this suit. On the\\ncontrary the report of the court commissioner is ad variance to the\\nevidence of P.W.1. Therefore I am of the view that the version of P.W.1\\nis not conclusive in nature. Hence I am of the considered view that the\\nplaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant has violated the\\nmunicipal laws and has constructed the illegal construction over the suit\\nproperty. The plaintiff has also failed to establish that by the act of the\\ndefendant running the school is causing disturbance to the people living\\nin the vicinity. Hence I have no hesitation to hold that the plaintiff is not\\nentitled for the relief’s as prayed for. Therefore Issue No.1, 2 and Addl.\\nIssue No. 1 in the Negative.6 O.S. No. 158/07\\n10.

The following point arises for my consideration:\\n1.

That inspite of issuance of\\nnotice on 5.9.2012 accused though received the notice\\nfailed comply with the notice and do not paying the\\ndishonored cheque amount within the stipulated time\\nand their by committed an offence punishable under\\nsection 138 of NI Act?\\n2. What Order?\\n8. My findings on points are as under:\\nPoint No.1: In the Affirmative\\nPoint No.2: As per final order\\nfor the following:\\nR E A S O N S.\\n9. Point No.1:- The present private is complaint is filed by the\\ncomplainant company against the accused for the offence punishable\\nU/s.138 of NI Act. It is the case of complainant company that accused had\\nborrowed the loan of Rs. 1,60,000/- total agreement value being Rs.\\n2,25,280/- to purchase the vehicle bearing No. KA-37 T/8088. Accused to\\npay the arrears to loan installments had issued a cheque dated 16.8.2012\\nwhich on presentation was dishonored as funds insufficient. On inspite of5 C.C.NO.496/12\\nissuance of notice on 5.9.2012 and service of the same within the\\nstipulated time accused failed to comply with the notice.\\n10. In order to establish these facts complainant company GPA\\nholder by name Nagraj Masangi was examined as PW.1. Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.11\\nare marked to the complainant. Ex.P.1 is the GPA given by the complainant\\nin favour of PW.1, Ex.P.2 is the cheque, Ex.P.3 and 4 are the bank memo,\\nEx.P.5 is the got legal notice, Ex.P.6 is the Postal acknowledgement. Ex.P.7\\nis the postal receipts, Ex.P.8 is the reply notice, another notice issued to\\naccused to repay the loan amount marked at Ex.P.9, account extract is\\nmarked at Ex.P.10, Ex.P.11 is the loan agreement.\\n11. PW.1 in his cross-examination has stated that he is working as\\na Recovery Executive that he does not no about the procedure for issuance\\nof loan by the company. He has stated that the loan is given on the basis\\nof market value of the vehicle and by taking guarantee. He has stated that\\na notice dated 8.3.2012 was issued prior to dishonored of cheque. He has\\ndenied the suggestion that at the time of lending of loan they got opened a\\nbank account in the name of accused of Bank of Baroda and they took 10\\nblank cheques from the accused. It is denied that the cheque booklets is\\nreceived in defence by the company. It is stated by PW.1 that the cheque\\nwas given by accused. he has stated that agreement value of Rs. 2,25,280\\nis on the basis financial charges. It is denied that the agreement value was\\nnot explained to the accused. He had denied the suggestion that at the\\ntime of loan agreement they received posted cheques from the borrower.6 C.C.NO.496/12\\nEx.D.1 the notice issued to accused was marked through PW-1. It is\\nadmitted by PW-1 them Ex.D.1 was issued by them. Stating that\\nRs.3,38,332/- is the remaining loan amount. Therefore PW.1 has stated\\nthat at the time of filing of this complaint the arrears was for a same\\namount as the amount in the cheque. He has denied the suggestion that\\naccused had sought for repaying Rs. 1,60,000/- in year 2011 stating that\\nthe rate of interest charged by the company is more. It is denied that they\\nhave presented the posted cheque issued by the accused at a earlier date.\\nPW.1 states that accused issued a cheque when issued the notice to\\nproduced the vehicle. On being suggested that accused is ready to pay the\\ncheque amount it is stated by PW.1 that the loan amount has increased.\\n12. It is defence of accused that the complainant company has\\nmisused the blank cheque given by at the time of lending of loan and that\\nthe company has charged higher rate of interest a principle amount.In\\norder to establish his evidence accused by name Veerabhadrappa was\\nexamined as DW-1. Ex.D1(a) and Ex.D.2 are receipts issued in favour of\\nthe accused, Ex.D.3 is reply notice given by the accused to the notice by\\nwhich the dishonored of cheque was intimated to accused. Ex.D.4 and\\nEx.D.5 are postal receipts and acknowledgments, Ex.D.6 is the notice\\ndated 5.9.2013. Dw.1 hi his chief examination has stated that he was not\\naver of the rate of interest charge by complainant. When he want to\\ndeposit the installment amount the company did not take the same, that\\ntook 6 blank cheques and two bonds security at the time of lending the\\nloan. Dw.2 in his cross examination admits his signature on Ex.P.11 the7 C.C.NO.496/12\\nloan agreement. He has stated he has not issued any notice to the\\ncomplainant stating that the rate of interest charged is more. He admits\\nthat complainant had issued notice to produce the vehicle and pay the loan\\namount. He admits that he did not produce the vehicle even after notice.\\nhe has denied the suggestion that complainant has misuse to cheque given\\nhave security.\\n13. Dw.2 by name Prakash Timmapur is the supporting witness\\nwho is stated that company had taken 6 cheques and two bonds from\\naccused at the time of lending of loan. That himself of DW.1 went to repay\\nthe principle amount stating that the rate of interest is high but the\\ncompany do not take the amount.\\n14. DW.2 in cross examination stated that himself and Dw.1 are\\nknown to each other since 7 to 8 years, he has stated that he cannot to\\nsay as to how many installments were due from accused and what is the\\nrate of interest. He has stated that accused paid the last installments in the\\nyear 2011. He admits that the company had issued notice to accused to\\nproduce the vehicle.\\n15. It was argued by learned counsel for complainant that the\\nissuance to cheque and the borrowing of loan is admitted by the accused\\nand as such it was prayed that accused convicted of the offence punishable\\nunder section 138 of NI Act. In support of his arguments he relied upon\\nthe following rulings.8 C.C.NO.496/12\\n1) 2010 (1) PROPERTY LAW DECISIONS 691 (SC)\\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nGrasim Industries Limited and Another\\nVs.\\nAgarwal Steel\\nDeeds and Documents-signing of document-Presumption\\narising thereform.\\nHeld: When a person signs a document, there is a\\npresumption, unless there is proof of force or fraud, that he\\nhas read the document properly and understood it and only\\nthen he has affixed his signatures thereon, otherwise no\\nsignature on a document can ever be accepted. In particular,\\nbusinessmen, being careful people (since their money is\\ninvolved) would have ordinarily read and understood a\\ndocument before signing it. Hence the presumption would be\\neven stronger in their case. (Para.6)\\n2) 2011 (2) DCR 337\\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\n(Anil Sanchar & ANR.)\\nv/s\\nM/s Shree nath Spinner P.Ltd.& ORS.

On the other hand learned counsel for accused argue them\\ncomplainant company has misuse the cheque given by accused as security.\\nThe learned counsel relied upon three rulings in respect of amendment to\\ncomplaint and use of blank cheque the same shall be discussed at relevant\\nparagraphs.\\n17. From perusal of the material on record, it is not in dispute that\\naccused had borrowed loan from complainant company for purchase of the\\nTractor. It is also not in dispute that he is in arrears to the complainant\\ncompany. It is the defence of accused that the company has misused the\\ncheque which was given as security and filed the present complainant.\\nThat accused is ready to pay the cheque amount. Now will have appreciate\\nwhether accused has been successful in establishing that the cheque was\\ngiven as a security at the time of borrowing of loan from the complainant\\ncompany. The accused except producing the notice copy issued by the\\ncomplainant and the reply given by him to complainant has not produced10 C.C.NO.496/12\\nany document to establish that cheques were given as security at the time\\nof borrowing the loan. Even in cross examination of PW.1 nothing was\\nelicited from his mouth to establish that the cheque at Ex.P.2 was taken\\nwas security.\\n18. Learned counsel for accused has taken up another defence that\\nthe complainant after filing of the plaint got amended the plaint and relied\\nupon the ruling reported in 2014 part I Crime Law Journal 182 (MP) where\\nin it is observed that the complainant cannot be permitted to amend the\\ncomplaint during trial to make correction in respect of the cheque number.\\nIn the present case the complainant sought amendment of the complainant\\nin respect of the loan advanced to accused and the agreement value and\\nthe same was prior to commencement of trial. Therefore in my opinion the\\nrolling relied upon by the accused will not be applicable to the case on\\nhand. Further learned accused counsel would rely upon ruling reported\\n1994 Cr LJ 2768 (Kerala) where in it is observed that when accused offered\\nto pay the cheque amount and the complainant refused the same the\\nperson liable to pay the amount is set to be discharged of his obligation\\nand the creditor is bound to accept the tender.\\n19. In the present case though accused has stated that he is ready\\nto pay the cheque amount but he has not done any overt act to manifest\\nthe same. Even in cross examination of PW.1 nothing was elicited from\\nmouth of PW.1 to establish that accused attempted to pay the dishonored\\ncheque amount. Therefore in my opinion the ruling relied upon by accused\\nwill not his case. The accused relied another ruling reported in 199511 C.C.NO.496/12\\nCriminal Law Journal 560 ,where in it is observed that the blank signed\\ncheque obtained from the accused as a security accused cannot be held to\\nbe liable of the offence. In present case accused has failed to establish that\\nthe cheque was issued as a security.\\n20. From perusal of Ex.P.2 to Ex.P.4 it is not in dispute that the\\ncheque issued by accused was dishonored for the reason as funds\\ninsufficient and accused failed to repay the cheque amount even after\\nissuance of notice. Ex.P.10 and 11 establish the borrowing of loan from the\\ncomplainant company by the accused. Though the accused has taken up\\nthe defence that 6 blank cheques were taken from him at the time of\\nlending of loan but accused is not successfull in establishing the defence.\\nEven he has failed to establish that the rate of interest charged by the\\ncompany is more.

(KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\n2. The prosecution case in brief is that;\\nThe accused Basavaraj Mangoji being a public servant was working\\nas Village Accountant of Tadkod village, Taluk: Dharwad during 2010. The\\nComplainant Kallayya S/o. Mallayya Meti on 5.12.2009 moved an\\napplication to the Department of Revenue to enter the name of his younger\\nbrother Jagadayya as the successor to the properties of one deceased\\nMadivalayya on the basis of his Will executed in favour of Jagadayya. In\\npursuance of the said application the complainant approached the accused\\nand made enquiries. The accused said it was not possible as one\\nKamalavva Mathapati had already filed an application to enter her name in\\nrespect of the property of Madivalayya. So, the complainant again on\\n23.1.2010 moved the learned Tahasildar Tq: Dharwad with an application.\\nThat application came to be referred to the Village Accountant. As a result\\nthe accused secured the complainant and his brother to his office and\\nmade a demand of illegal gratification of Rs.10,000/- to favour the\\ncomplainant brother in respect of the entries. The complainant being\\nunwilling to pay the said bribe of Rs.10,000/- approached Dharwad\\nLokayukta Police and received a voice recorder at the instance of the\\npolice and again approached the accused on 15.2.2010 at about 5 p.m.\\nand once again enquired the accused. The accused even on that occasion\\nalso repeated his demand for Rs.10,000/-. That was recorded by the\\ncomplainant using the said voice recorder and came back to the LokayuktaJudgment 3 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nOffice on 16.2.2010 and registered his complaint. The Lokayukta Police\\nafter conducting entrustment panchanama when proceeded to conduct the\\nalleged trap, the accused on 16-2-2010 at 5 p.m. in a room situated in\\nDeshpande Chawl behind Dr.Rajan Deshpnade’s hospital, Dharwad\\ndemanded and accepted a bribe of Rs.10,000/- from C.W.1 – Kallayya\\nMallayya Meti as gratification other than legal remuneration for mutating\\nthe name of Jagadayya in respect of the properties of deceased\\nMadivalayya. So, the investigating officer having conducted successful trap\\nand trap mahazar on obtaining the required sanction at a later stage from\\nthe competent authority to prosecute the accused has laid the charge\\nsheet against the accused for the alleged offences.\\n3. After hearing both sides, this court has duly framed the charges for\\nthe alleged offences against the accused. The accused having denied the\\ncharges levelled against him has claimed to be tried and accordingly the\\nprosecution in order to establish the guilt of the accused has examined\\ntotally 13 witnesses as P.Ws.1 to 13 and has produced documents at\\nEx.P.1 to P.45 and 14 material objects are produced.\\n4. The statement of the accused u/s.313 Cr.P.C. is recorded and the\\naccused has submitted his written statement along with some certified\\ncopies of documents.Judgment 4 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\n5. I have heard the arguments of the learned Spl. P.P. for the State\\nand the learned defence council.\\n[\\n6. The points that arise for my consideration are;\\n01. Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable\\ndoubts that the accused as a public servant working\\nas Village Accountant of Tadkod village on\\n16.2.2010 at 5 p.m. in a room in Deshpande Chawl ,\\nDharwad demanded and accepted an illegal\\ngratification of Rs.10,000/- from P.W.1 – Kallayya\\nMeti as a reward for mutating the name of his\\nbrother Jagadayya in respect of property bearing\\nblock Nos.240 and 256 of Tadkod village ?\\n02. Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable\\ndoubts that, accused has committed criminal\\nmisconduct as alleged?\\n03. Whether the sanction order to prosecute the\\naccused is valid?\\n7. My answer to the above points are as under.\\nPoint No.1 – In the negative.\\nPoint No.2 – In the negative.Judgment 5 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nPoint No.3 - In the negative.\\nReasons\\n8. Points No.1 and 2:\\nI proceed to consider these two points together for the purpose of\\nconvenience and to avoid repetition of facts as they are inter related.\\nThe learned Spl. Public Prosecutor submits that, the complainant in\\norder to get the name of his brother one Jagadayya Madivalayya Meti\\nmutated in the revenue records pertaining to the properties of deceased\\nMadivalayya Rudrayya Meti approached the accused – B.R. Mangoji after\\nhis brother moved an application Dtd: 5.12.2009 to ‘Nemmadi Kendra ’ of\\nRevenue Department at Garag Village. By then another application was\\nmoved by one Kamalawwa Mathapati and Somawwa Madli, claiming\\nthemselves as legal heirs of deceased Madivalayya, to enter their name to\\nthe properties of deceased Madivalayya, as his successors. Even then the\\naccused demanded an illegal gratification of Rs.10,000/- from P.W.1 –\\nComplainant Kallayya to do an official favour in favour of his brother. The\\ncomplainant being unwilling to depart with the said illegal bribe amount of\\nRs.10,000/- approached Lokayukta Police only to register the case against\\nthe accused. Subsequently the accused has been successfully trapped\\nred-handed while receiving the amount of Rs.10,000/- from the\\ncomplainant as an illegal gratification on demand. This illegal act of theJudgment 6 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\naccused has been clearly established by examining the complainant\\nP.W.1, P.W.2 – co-panch. Though P.W.3 shadow panch has turned\\nhostile, he has later on supported the case in the course of his cross-\\nexamination. There can be no dispute that Rs.10,000/- the so called bribe\\namount has been recovered from the possession of the accused. The\\nhand wash, the evidence of P.W.1, P.W.2 – co-panch coupled with the\\nevidence of investigating officer clearly establishes the recovery of the\\nbribe amount from the possession of the accused. So the submission is\\nthat, there is no reason to disbelieve the case of the prosecution as no\\nvillager will depart with an amount of Rs.10,000/- unless there were\\nnegotiations of the bribe amount by the accused. It is also submitted that,\\nno police authority could file the false case against anybody. Thereby the\\naccused deserves to be convicted for the alleged offences. On the contrary\\nthe learned defence counsel Sri. K.B. Navalagimath would argue that the\\nso called application Dtd: 5.12.2009 said to have been given by Jagadayya\\nto ‘Nemmadi Kendra’ at Garag is not forthcoming in the entire evidence of\\nthe prosecution. There is nothing on record to show that, either the\\ncomplainant or his brother Jagadayya have moved any application for\\nmutating the name of Jagadayya to the properties of deceased\\nMadivalayya. When such is the case, there was no occasion for the\\naccused to demand the alleged bribe. On this count alone the entire case\\nof the prosecution collapses at the very threshold. Including theJudgment 7 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ninvestigating officer has not at all cared to verify minimum record to find out\\nexistence of a prima-facie case and has proceeded to register the case\\nand the alleged trap is said to have been conducted. Similarly the\\nsanctioning authority without verifying the records pertaining to the\\nprosecution of the accused has mechanically proceeded to accord the\\nsanction and hence even the sanction is not proper and legal. The other\\nsubmission is though the name of Jagadayya was sought to be mutated he\\nis not at all there in the picture in prosecuting the accused. The\\ndocumentary evidence on record shows that when the accused followed\\nthe due process of law on the strength of an application of female\\nmembers i..e. Kallavva Mathapati and Somavva Madli mentioned above\\nissued notices to them, this P.W.1 complainant made his entry with intent\\nto put hurdle to the accused to follow the due process of law got filed this\\nfalse case. There is no clear credible evidence to show that this accused\\ndemanded Rs.10,000/- from the complainant. Mere recovery of the amount\\nfrom the possession of the accused cannot be based to hold that he is\\nguilty of the offences under section 7 and 13(1)(d) of Prevention of\\nCorruption Act, 1988. Absolutely there is no strength in the prosecution\\ncase. When no offence is made out under section 7 of the Act, question of\\nconsidering the other offences like 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Act cannot be\\ntaken into consideration. As such it is prayed to acquit the accused. BasingJudgment 8 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\non these rival grounds urged on both sides, I proceed to appreciate both\\noral and documentary evidence on record.\\n9. Ex.P.1 – complaint speaks to the effect that, deceased Madivalayya\\n- senior paternal uncle of the complainant and his brother Jagadayya had\\nno male or female issues. The said Madivalayya accordingly adopted\\nJagadayya on 5.5.2009. Then on 19.5.2009 Madivalayya died leaving\\nbehind his only adopted son Jagadayya – the younger brother of\\ncomplainant. Madivalayya has also executed a Will bequeathing his share\\nin the joint family property. Then subsequent to the death of Madivalayya,\\nJagadayya filed an application Dtd: 5.12.2009 before ‘Nemmadi Kendra’\\nto get his name entered as successor to deceased Madivalayya. The copy\\nof the Will executed by Madivalayya was also annexed to the said\\napplication. Thereafter in connection with the said application this\\ncomplainant approached the present accused. At that time itself the\\naccused informed the complainant regarding an application already moved\\nby Smt. Kamalawwa W/o. Rachayya Mathapati and Smt. Somawwa Kom\\nAdivayya Madli seeking to enter their name as successors to deceased\\nMadivalayya Meti and accordingly the accused also informed the\\ncomplainant that name of Jagadayya could not be entered. So on\\n23.1.2010 this complainant filed objections before the Tahasildar, who\\ninturn referred to the Village Accountant. On receipt of the said objectionJudgment 9 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nthe accused summoned and secured both this complainant and his brother\\nJagadayya to his office and made a demand of illegal gratification of\\nRs.10,000/- to enter the name of Jagadayya rejecting the application of the\\nsaid female members. The complainant said that it was only his brother\\nJagadayya who is the legal heir of deceased Madivalayya and hence there\\nwas no need for him to give any bribe. But, the accused emphatically\\nmade it clear that, unless the amount of bribe was given, he could not\\ncarry out the work of complainant and enter the name of Jagadayya in\\nrespect of the properties of Madivalayya. Thereby the complainant who\\nwas not willing to pay the bribe amount as demanded by the accused\\napproached Lokayukta Police on 15.2.2010 at 11 A.M. secured a micro\\ntape recorder and again approached the accused, recorded the speech of\\nthe accused demanding the bribe amount and then came back to\\nLokayukta Police Station and registered the complaint on 16.2.2010.\\n10. The evidence of P.W.1 – Kallayya is that, to bring on record the\\nbrother Jagadayya as legal heir of deceased Madivalayya he had given an\\napplication in ‘Nemmadi Kendra’ about two months after the death of\\nMadivalayya. But the said entry was not made. Therefore, he had met the\\naccused who was his Village Accountant. There he asked the complainant\\nto pay Rs.10,000/- as expenses to enter the name of Jagadayya as legal\\nheir of Madivalayya otherwise work could not be executed. So, the specificJudgment 1 0 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ncase of the prosecution is that, pursuant to the application Dtd: 5.12.2009\\nsubmitted to ‘Nemmadi Kendra’ the complainant approached the accused\\nand that was an occasion for the accused to demand the alleged bribe\\namount. Therefore, it is for the prosecution to establish that such an\\napplication Dtd: 5.12.2009 was pending for consideration before the\\naccused as on the alleged date i.e. the day on which this complainant\\napproached the accused seeking an official favour. In the course of cross-\\nexamination the complainant has given a contrary version than that of his\\nown complaint. He has admitted that, Kamalawwa and Somawwa after\\nattending the obsequies of Madivalayya had given an application to the\\nTahasildar for mutating their names as legal heirs of Madivalayya in\\nrespect of three items of the land. The further admission is his brother\\nJagadayya had filed objections in Taluk Office opposing the said\\napplication of Kamalawwa and Somawwa and Tahasildar had sent the said\\nobjections to the accused through the Revenue Inspector to submit the\\nreport that it was a disputed matter. The further clear admission is he had\\nnot filed any application to revenue authorities to mutate the name of\\nJagadayya in concerned records with respect to the properties of\\nMadivalayya as his legal heir after his death and P.W.1 does not know\\nwhether Jagadayya or any person on his behalf had given any such\\napplication and for issue of warsa certificate showing that Jagadayya is the\\nheir of Madivalayya he gave an application to ‘Nemmadi Kendra’. OnJudgment 1 1 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ncontradiction of Ex.D.1 – the application of Jagadayya Dtd: 5.12.2009\\nP.W.1 has admitted the same application given by him to ‘Nemmadi\\nKendra’ for obtaining warsa certificate. But admittedly on that application\\nitself this accused being the Village Accountant made an endorsement\\nthat, warsa certificate as sought for on the basis of adoption deed cannot\\nbe given and that is to be obtained from the court of law. His endorsement\\nwas accepted even by the Revenue Inspector and then the Tahasildar.\\nAccordingly the Tahasildar proceeded to pass an order directing\\nJagadayya to obtain warsa certificate from the court of law. This\\nendorsement of the accused as could be seen from Ex.D.1 was made on\\n16.12.2009 itself after he received the said application Dtd: 5.12.2009 at\\nhis office on 12.12.2009. Then on 2.3.2010 the learned Tahasildar basing\\non the report of Village Accountant made his endorsement directing the\\nP.W.1 or Jagadayya to obtain the warsa certificate from the court of law.\\nAccordingly an endorsement Dtd: 28.3.2010 was issued to Jagadayya as\\nper Ex.P.40. The combined reading of Ex.D.1 and Ex.P.40 makes it\\nevident that, much earlier to the alleged date of demand of bribe by the\\naccused on 15.2.2010 no application given either by P.W.1 or by his\\nbrother P.W.10 – Jagadayya was pending for consideration before the\\naccused or for that matter before any of the revenue authority. The so\\ncalled application Dtd: 5.12.2009 was disposed of by this accused on\\n16.12.2009. So the case of the prosecution that, on 16.2.2010 when theJudgment 1 2 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ncomplainant approached the accused in connection with the application\\nDtd: 5.12.2009 subsequent to registering the complaint before Lokayukta\\nthe accused made a demand for illegal gratification and then accepted the\\nsame appears to be untrustworthy. I rather feel that there is no genesis of\\nthe case.\\n11. The Special Public Prosecutor submits that, irrespective of pendency\\nof the application Dtd:5.12.2009 said to have been filed by the complainant\\nseeking change of entry in favour of his brother, the case of the\\nprosecution in no way can be disbelieved. Supporting his contention the\\nreference is made to para 4 of the complaint wherein it is stated that, on\\n23.1.2010 in connection with the change of entry a statement of objection\\nwas filed by the complainant. This true fact if considered along with the\\nearlier facts stated in the complaint it would clearly show that, said\\nstatement of objections was filed to an application of Kamalawwa and\\nSomawwa and in continuation of the same this complainant did approach\\nthe accused seeking an official favour to his brother and to see that, the\\napplication of female members was not entered and by rejecting the same\\nthe accused could get some favourable order in favour of Jagadayya – the\\nbrother of complainant. Accordingly the clear allegation is made in the\\ncomplaint and supporting to the same, the complainant has clearly\\ndeposed his evidence before the court. In the evidence in chief, of courseJudgment 1 3 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nthe P.W.1 has stated that, one Kamalawwa and Somawwa claiming\\nthemselves as daughters of his deceased uncle Madivalayya had given an\\napplication in Taluk office to enter their name as his L.Rs. and that was\\ninformed to him by the accused. Then the accused also told him that, if\\ncomplainant would given him Rs.10,000/- he could set the things right by\\nover ruling the objections of Kamalawwa and Somawwa. Basing on this\\npiece of evidence and the recitals of the complainant the learned Spl.,\\nPublic Prosecutor submitted that, the accused being the Village\\nAccountant who was to make his report to his higher authorities so as to\\nfavour the complainant and his brother demanded the illegal gratification\\nand that clearly stands established from the complaint, his evidence\\ncoupled with the evidence of P.W.10 – Jagadayya and the investigating\\nofficer – P.W.13.\\n12. The complainant in his cross-examination as already mentioned\\nabove has stated that, he did not file any application before the revenue\\nauthorities to mutate the name of his brother Jagadayya in the concerned\\nrevenue records as legal representative of deceased Madivalayya. It is\\nalso said that he does not know whether such an application was filed\\neither by Jagadayya or any other person on his behalf. Then the evidence\\nof P.W.10 – Jagadayya, who according to the brother P.W.1 is the\\nbeneficiary under a Will said to have been executed by his adopted fatherJudgment 1 4 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ndeceased Madivalayya has given altogether a different evidence and\\ncontrary to the case of the prosecution. His evidence is that subsequent to\\nthe death of Madivalayya he moved an application to obtain a warsa\\ncertificate and to issue such a document the Village Accountant (accused)\\ndemanded a sum of Rs.10,000/-. From his evidence it is also evident that,\\nhe never approached the accused and he did not see him. It is only his\\nbrother Kallayya who is looking after his official work. From the reading of\\nhis entire evidence it could clearly be seen that, this key witness P.W.10 –\\nJagadayya is totally innocent of the facts of the case. It appears that, this\\ncase has been initiated keeping the P.W.10 – Jagadayya in darkness.\\n13. Moving to the evidence of P.W.13 – the investigating officer, he\\nhas made it clear in his cross-examination that, in the course of\\ninvestigation he has recovered an application given to the Revenue\\nDepartment seeking to enter the name of Jagadayya in the revenue\\nrecords concerned. When he was specifically asked to find out such a\\nrecord in the prosecution case papers the learned officer has referred to\\nEx.P.25(b) Dtd: 22.1.2010. The clear reading of the said document\\nindicates that, it was an objection statement filed by Jagadayya to the\\napplication of Smt. Kamalawwa and Somawwa. Added to that, P.W.13\\nasserts that, this was the application given by the complainant by denying\\nthe suggestion for the accused. Ex.P.25 (a) is the application of Smt.Judgment 1 5 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nKamalawwa and Somawwa claiming themselves as the daughters of\\ndeceased Madivalayya to enter their names in the revenue records\\npertaining to the properties of deceased Madivalayya. In spite of\\ncontradiction of Ex.P.25(a) & (b) two important documents, the P.W.13 –\\nInspector was not prepared to accept the suggestion that, no application\\nwas moved to enter the name of Jagadayya in the revenue record\\nconcerned. So it also appears that, even the investigating officer did not\\nmake the minimum efforts to know whether any application either Dtd:\\n5.12.2009 or any other date was pending with the revenue authority\\nseeking change of entry in favour of Jagadayya.\\n14. Here the other relevant aspect to be taken into consideration is as\\nper the clear allegation levelled in the complaint and as well in the\\nevidence of P.W.1 subsequent to the filing of the application Dtd:\\n5.12.2009, this complainant approached the accused for a favour to his\\nbrother Jagadayya and that was the occasion on which the accused\\ndemanded the alleged illegal gratification. At that particular point of time no\\napplication seeking change of entry in favour of Jagadayya was pending\\nfor consideration before the accused. For the first time on 20.11.2009 the\\nlearned Tahasildar, Dharwad was moved by the so called female members\\nwith an application as per Ex.P.25(a). Thereafter on 23.1.2010 the\\nEx.P.25(b) objections came to be filed by Jagadayya. With this theJudgment 1 6 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nevidence of P.W.9 - Mallikarjun Biradar the then Revenue Circle Inspector\\nof the area concerned requires to be considered. The evidence of this\\nofficer in the cross-examination clearly reflects on the legal procedures\\nfollowed when an application is received for change of entry in the revenue\\nrecords. Accordingly Jagadayya of Tadkod village had given an application\\nto the Tahasildar along with the revenue records. This witness on\\ncontradiction of Ex.P.25(a) says, that is the application which was given by\\nJagadayya for change of entry. On going through the said document he\\nhas again said that, that was the application given by Kamalawwa and\\nSomawwa to enter their name in place of their father deceased\\nMadivalayya and to that application Jagadayya had submitted his\\nobjections. Further clear admission is that, no application of Jagadayya\\nwas given for change of entry. So it stands established that, the\\nprosecution now completely wants to bank upon Ex.P.25(a) and (b). The\\nfurther evidence of P.W.9 is that the Ex.P.25 – application when came to\\nhim from the Tahasildar he sent it to the accused for issue of notice on the\\nsame to the parties concerned. Accordingly the accused had also issued\\nnotices to the applicants namely Kamalawwa and Somawwa and a copy of\\nthe notice was published in a conspicuous place of village ‘chavadi’. The\\napplication Ex.P.25(a) was received by P.W.9 on 19.1.2010 and it was\\nsent to the accused on 21.1.2010. Admittedly the normal procedure is that,\\nthe Village Accountant on receiving the application issues notices to theJudgment 1 7 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nparties giving 30 days time for their responses and the Village Accountant\\nhas to wait for 30 days. In case he receives any objections to such an\\napplication then that matter is treated as the revenue dispute and again\\nsent back to the Tahasildar for enquiry through proper channel. Here the\\nfurther evidence of P.W.9 is that on 23.1.2010 the objection statement of\\nJagadayya was received by the Village Accountant and on the same day\\nthe accused had made an endorsement on the application of the female\\nmembers stating that, the objection has been received and it had gone to\\nthe knowledge of this P.W.9 - Revenue Inspector. Then on 28.1.2010\\nitself this P.W.9 being the higher authority of the accused had directed the\\naccused to send back the proceeding treating it as a revenue dispute.\\nWhen this is the clear evidence on record the submission of the learned\\nPublic Prosecutor that, irrespective of the pendency of the application\\nwhether the accused as the Village Accountant of the area was in a\\nposition to use in his official capacity to help the complainant or his brother\\nand accordingly there was an occasion for him to demand the alleged\\nbribe requires to be considered holds no substance.\\n15. One other ground urged for the prosecution is, there can be no\\ndispute regarding the recovery of Rs.10,000/- alleged bribe amount from\\nthe hands of the accused. The evidence of the complainant, co-panch and\\nthe investigating officer supported by hand wash clearly establishes thatJudgment 1 8 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nthe said tainted money which was received from the complainant during\\nthe entrustment mahazar has been clearly recovered from the hands of the\\naccused. So a presumption as contemplated under section 20 of the\\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is very much available for the\\nprosecution. The law is well established that no presumption in law is\\nunrebutable. The statutory presumption can be rebutted either by adducing\\ndefence evidence or by cross-examining the prosecution witnesses.\\nBasing on the available materials on record itself the accused is at liberty\\nto dislodge any such presumption arising in favour of the prosecution. So\\nfar as the presumption arising under section 20 of the Act, the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court in the case of State of Maharastra Vs. Dnyaneshwar\\nLaxmanrao Wankhede reported in (2010)2 S.C.C.(Cril)385 and in other\\ncases has repeatedly made it very clear that it is a settled canon of\\nCriminal jurisprudence that the conviction of an accused cannot be\\nfounded on the basis of inference. The offence should be proved against\\nthe accused beyond reasonable doubt either by direct evidence or even by\\ncircumstantial evidence. In disputably, the demand of illegal gratification is\\na sine-qua-non for constitution of an offence under the provisions of the\\nAct. For arriving at the conclusion as to whether all ingredients of an\\noffence namely demand, acceptance and recovery of the amount of illegal\\ngratification have been satisfied or not, the court must take into\\nconsideration the facts and circumstances brought on record. TheJudgment 1 9 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\npresumptive evidence as provided under section 20 of the Act, must also\\nbe taken into consideration. But, then in respect thereof, the standard of\\nburden of proof on the accused vis-à-vis the standard of burden of proof on\\nthe prosecution would differ. Before the accused is called upon to explain\\nas to how the amount in question was found in his possession, the\\nfoundational facts must be established by the prosecution. So, even while\\ninvoking the provisions of Sec.20 of the Act, the court is expected to\\nconsider the explanation offered by the accused.\\n16. In this behalf the learned defence counsel has also taken me\\nthrough a decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of C.M. Girish\\nBabu Vs.C.B.I. Cochin reported in AIR 2009 Supreme Court 2022. The\\nspecific defence of the accused is the complainant Kallayya approached\\nhim to enter the name of adopted son in place of deceased Madivalayya to\\nhis properties on receipt of his application given to the Taluk Office. But as\\nthe accused gave his explanation in Ex.P.26. No such application of the\\ncomplainant was received by him specifically when the complainant\\napproached him. I have already made it clear that there is no evidence to\\nshow that, Kallayya or for that matter his brother Jagadayya ever filed any\\nsuch application for change of entry. So when no application of any kind\\neither of Kallayya or of Jagadayya was pending before the accused at the\\nrelevant point of time, the case of the prosecution that, the accused madeJudgment 2 0 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\na demand of illegal gratification appears to be very weak. Without there\\nbeing any material before him and that too when the application of other\\nparty i.e. the female members was received by him for the same work, it is\\nvery difficult to believe in the normal circumstances that accused could\\nhave ventured to demand for an illegal gratification. So, his defence that\\nthough he did not demand the amount for himself as a reward or motive,\\nthe complainant himself thrusted the said amount of Rs.10,000/- in his\\npocket, in all probability appears to be credible. Another material point\\nwhich requires worth mentioning here is, the accused had already made\\nhis endorsement on the application of the female members pursuant to the\\nobjections of Jagadayya as a disputed matter and that being so, the\\naccused in his individual capacity as the Village Accountant was not in a\\nposition to help the complainant. Any order to enter the name of either\\nJagadayya or female members was to be passed by the learned\\nTahasildar. It is not the prosecution case that, this accused demanded the\\namount of Rs.10,000/- as a motive or reward on behalf of his superiors. As\\nsuch basing on the evidence of the complainant, his brother Jagadayya\\nand the official documents recovered in this case, in my clear view the\\naccused succeeds in proving the preponderance of probabilities in favour\\nof his defence. With this, I am of the considered view that, the presumption\\nu/s.20 of the Act is not even available for the prosecution. So mere\\nrecovery of the alleged tainted money of Rs.10,000/- from the possessionJudgment 2 1 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nof the accused cannot be based to believe the case of the prosecution\\nregarding the demand and consequential acceptance of the bribe amount\\nby the complainant. The similar principle is laid down in the case of R\\nMalini Vs. State of Karnataka reported in 2012(1) KCCR 414 quoted for the\\naccused. Thereby from the so called recovery of the amount two\\ninferences are possible in the case on hand from the over all evidence on\\nrecord. AT the first instance the facts and circumstances on hand tend to\\npoint out regarding the motive on the part of the accused to make a\\ndemand of bribe so as to use his office for favouring the complainant.\\nSecondly, the entire evidence so far discussed probabalises that, the\\ncomplainant might have cooked up a false story of demand of bribe with a\\nview to save himself from any kind of action against him by the accused or\\nto put some force on the revenue authority concerned to get his work\\ndone. When this is so, as per the established principle of law the inference\\nfavouring the accused has to be preferred and in such case it is not safe to\\nrely on the evidence of the complainant so far as the demand of bribe is\\nconcerned. Above all this coming to the evidence of P.W.2 – co-panch, he\\nhas of course given his evidence in tune with Ex.P.2 entrustment mahazar\\nand Ex.P.14 trap mahazar. The other key witness i.e. P.W.3 shadow\\npanch, according to the prosecution who accompanied the complainant at\\nthe time of alleged bribe transaction between the complainant and the\\naccused has not supported even the entrustment mahazar and also theJudgment 2 2 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ntrap mahazar. From his evidence the sanctity as to the hand wash at the\\ntime of both mahazars becomes doubtful. So far as the trap is concerned\\nthat this witness has stated that, the complainant alone went inside the\\noffice of the accused, gave him the amount and came outside to give\\nsignal to the police. At that time including himself all went inside. This is\\nquite contrary to the case of the prosecution. According to him the said\\namount was kept by the accused in his trouser pocket and that amount\\nwas got removed by the accused. Thereafter his hand wash was taken. So\\nthis version of creates a serious suspicion regarding the recovery of\\nalleged tainted money. It is relevant to note that even in the cross-\\nexamination by way of a clear suggestion it is tried to contend that, the\\napplication of the complainant given to the revenue authority for change of\\nrevenue entry in favour of his brother Jagadayya the adopted son of\\ndeceased Madivalayya had come to the accused at the relevant point of\\ntime and in that connection only the bribe amount of Rs.10,000/- was\\ndemanded by the accused. First of all no such application was pending\\nand it was received by the accused. So, even the admission of this witness\\nin the cross-examination receives no value. Likewise the entire reading of\\nthe cross-examination of this witness by the prosecution strongly indicates\\nthat, this witness has simply proceeded to give the favourable answer to\\nthe prosecution admitting each and every leading question. From the\\nreading of his evidence it is seen that, the said evidence is not safe to beJudgment 2 3 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nbelieved. It is only the complainant and this shadow witness who have\\ndeposed regarding the demand and acceptance of the bribe amount in\\nrespect of the so called application of Jagadayya. Their evidence in no way\\ncan be based to believe the demand and acceptance. So, merely the\\nevidence of co-panch P.W.2 is not sufficient enough to believe the case of\\nthe prosecution without there being the corroboration by P.Ws.1 and 3.\\n17. So far as the conversation between the accused and the\\ncomplainant regarding the alleged demand and then acceptance of bribe\\namount by the accused, both mahazars show that whatever recorded\\nusing the voice recorder was not properly audible. Even then this witness\\ncould hear and identify one of the voice recorded therein as that of the\\naccused. On this aspect the officials who are said to have identified the\\nsaid voice of the accused are examined in this case are P.Ws.4 and 7.\\nThey have clearly denied the case that the C.D. and the voice recorder\\nwere played before them and they identified one of the voices as that of\\nthe accused. The other aspect according to these officials is that, at the\\ntime of the alleged trap they were not at all present there on the spot and\\nthey did not even appear to the spot at the instance of the Revenue\\nInspector. P.W.4 and 7 both have said that later in the night they came to\\nknow about the alleged trap of the accused and pursuant to the information\\ngiven to them by the police they had been to the Lokayukta Police station.Judgment 2 4 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nP.W.4- Kariyappa Muttagi has specifically denied his presence on\\n16.2.2010 in the premises of Deshpande Chawl at the time of the alleged\\ntrap. Similar is the evidence of P.W.7. So, even the so called conversation\\nsaid to have been recorded from the voice recorder are also difficult to be\\nbelieved. The other chance witness P.W.5 – Fakirappa, P.W.6 –\\nVeerabhadrappa Ullagaddi have all turned hostile. According to the\\nprosecution they happened to be present at the time of alleged trap and\\nthey personally witnessed the recovery of so called bribe amount from the\\npossession of the accused. That is all denied by the witnesses. When this\\nis so on any count it cannot be said that the alleged demand and then the\\nacceptance of bribe amount is established beyond reasonable doubts.\\n18. The learned defence counsel has taken me through the decision of\\nour Hon’ble High Court in the case of K.A Prabhakar Vs. State of\\nKarnataka reported in 2012(1) KCCR 388, wherein it is held that; When\\nthe demand of bribe as contemplated under section 7 of the Act is not\\nestablished. There is no point to proceeding to convict for the offence\\npunishable under section 13(1)(d) of the Act.\\n19. In the instant case the prosecution has utterly failed to prove that\\nthis accused on the alleged date, time and place demanded the illegal\\ngratification of Rs.10,000/- from the complainant as a motive or reward toJudgment 2 5 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ndo an official favour to him. The other allegation that he has committed the\\noffence punishable under section 13(1)(d) read with sec.13(2) of the Act\\nneeds no consideration. In the result, I answer Points No. 1 and 2 in the\\nNegative.\\n20.Point No.3:\\nThe learned defence counsel attacking the order of sanction has\\nsubmitted that, the said order was practically drafted by Lokayukta Police\\nand the learned Deputy Commissioner P.W.12 has simply signed the\\nsame without applying his independent mind to the prosecution records.\\nThe learned sanctioning authority being the responsible officer has not\\neven cared to verify whether there any application of Jagadayya or even\\nthe complainant seeking change of revenue entry was pending either\\nbefore the accused or before the learned Tahasildar. Merely basing on the\\nreport of the Lokayukta Police Inspector he has proceeded to subscribe his\\nsignature to the draft sanction order.\\n21. Per contra the learned Public Prosecutor submits that, the sanction\\nin question was given only after verification of records and the learned\\nDeputy Commissioner got satisfied himself regarding the case against the\\naccused. The other submission is that no police authority would file false\\ncase against anybody and no responsible sanctioning authority like theJudgment 2 6 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\nlearned Deputy Commissioner would simply accord the sanction merely\\nbasing on the police version. So, there can be no ground to treat the order\\nof sanction on hand as bad in law.\\n22. From the aforesaid discussion it is evident that, either the\\ncomplainant on behalf of his brother or Jagadayya himself moved any\\nrevenue authority concerned with an application seeking to enter his name\\nin place of deceased Madivalayya as his adopted son in respect of the\\nproperties of deceased Madivalayya. This factual aspect was apparent on\\nthe face of the record. The P.W.12 – Sanctioning Authority has made it\\nclear in his cross-examination that there was no information regarding any\\napplication directly filed by Jagadayya Meti before the learned Tahasildar\\nseeking to delete the name of deceased Madivalayya and in his place to\\nenter his name. The specific case of the prosecution is that complainant\\nKallayya being the brother of Jagadayya Meti in pursuance of such an\\napplication approached the accused and gave an opportunity for him to\\ndemand the alleged bribe. The learned Deputy Commissioner ought to\\nhave basically verified regarding the pendency of any such application\\nbefore the authority concerned and so also regarding pendency of any\\nwork of the complainant with the accused at the relevant point of time.\\nAdmittedly this was not done by P.W.12 prior to subscribe his signature to\\nthe draft order of sanction with some modifications as said by him in theJudgment 2 7 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ncross-examination. The decision of our Hon’ble High Court in the case of\\nPolice Inspector Lokayukta, Bangalore Division, Bangalore and\\nM.Nanjunda, Village Accountant, Bettadalasur, Bangalore Rural cited for\\nthe accused has clearly dealt with the philosophy behind according\\nsanction to prosecute a public servant. The relevant observation reads :\\nThere is very deep - seated and well defined philosophy\\nbehind the requirement for sanction in corruption cases,\\nthe first of them being that the consequences of accord of\\nsanction are very disastrous to the public servant both as\\nfar as his job, his reputation and even his social standing\\nare concerned. It is therefore very important that the\\nsanctioning authority must independently peruse the\\ninvestigation papers and independently of the police\\nreport come to the conclusion that there is enough\\nmaterial to sustain the charge. If there are infirmities in\\nthe investigation, if the evidence gathered is weak, or if\\non an overall view of the material produced by the\\ninvestigating agency there is really no valid case made\\nout or no case that could ever sustain a conviction, then\\nmerely because the authority has asked for sanction, it\\nwould not be correct for sanction to be accorded. There is\\nanother aspect of the law which this court has laid down\\nrecently viz., that there are a class of misconducts which\\ncould be adequately dealt with through disciplinary or\\ndepartmental proceedings and it is this class of small\\ncases wherein it would be inappropriate to grant sanction\\nof adequate punishment could be awarded throughJudgment 2 8 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\ndisciplinary or departmental proceedings. Whether the\\ncase is one which therefore validly justifies a prosecution\\ninsofar as it is serious enough to warrant the heavy\\npunishments prescribed under the Prevention of\\nCorruption Act or whether it is one which can be\\nadequately punished through disciplinary proceedings is\\nan aspect which the sanctioning authority is required to\\njudicially consider before granting sanction.\\nSimilarly even in view of the decision of Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of\\nState of Karnataka Vs. Ameer Jan reported in 2008 CRI.L.J. 347, the\\nperusal of sanction order in the light of the evidence of the P.W.12 the\\nlearned Deputy Commissioner makes me to hold that the learned Deputy\\nCommissioner has not bothered to verify the records independently of the\\npolice report and to get satisfied regarding prima-facie case for prosecuting\\nthe accused. With this I hold that the sanction also cannot be held as\\nvalid. In the result, I answer the 3rd point in the Negative.\\n23. Coming to the application under section 340 of the Cr.P.C. moved by\\nthe learned Special Public Prosecutor for initiating an action against\\nP.Ws.3 to 7 for having failed to support the case of the prosecution\\ndeposing their evidence contrary to their statements made before the\\nInvestigating officer during investigation, the Investigating officer in his\\ncross-examination has stated that during his investigating he recovered theJudgment 2 9 Spl. (KLA).C.C. No 03/2011.\\napplication filed by Jagadayya seeking to delete the name of Madivalayya\\nand in his place to enter his name in the revenue records. When asked to\\nidentify and to show such an application on record the investigation officer\\nhas pointed out Ex.P.25(b). Which is certainly not the application of\\nJagadayya because Ex.P.25(b) was the statement of objections of\\nJagadayya Dtd: 23.1.2010 to the application of Kamalawwa and\\nSomawwa. As per the case of the prosecution this was not the application\\npursued by Kallayya. Even after going through the said document the\\ninvestigating officer continues to say that Ex.P.25(b) was the application of\\nJagadayya. Added to that, even the complainant himself, as earlier pointed\\nout has stated that he did not file any such application and he did not know\\nany such application being filed by his brother. When such is the case\\nmerely because the P.W.3 to 7 have given contrary evidence to that of\\ntheir statements before the investigating officer action as sought for under\\nsection 340 would serve no purpose. Accordingly the application does not\\nwarrant any action.\\n24. In the result, I proceed to pass the following;\\nOrder\\nActing U/s.235(01) of Cr.P.C. the accused is hereby\\nacquitted for the offences punishable U/Secs. 07,Judgment 3 0 Spl. (KLA).C.C.

Brief case of the complainant/respondent before\\nthe trial court that:\\nIt is a non banking financial institution registered\\nunder the Indian Companies Act. Accused availed the\\nloan of Rs.3,20,000/- from the complainant at Dharwad\\nbranch to purchase an Ashok Layland Vehicle of 2000\\nmodel bearing No.KA-22/A 7895 and he has executed\\nnecessary documents in favour of the complainant and\\nagreed to repay the loan amount in monthly installments.\\nIt is further urged that accused was failed to repay\\nthe loan amount. On repeated demands accused issued a3 Crl. Appeal No.17/2014\\ncheque for Rs.1,10,000/- bearing No.198128 dated\\n4/2/2010 drawn on ING Vaishya Bank Azad Park road\\nDharwad. When the said cheque was presented for\\nencashment and same was returned as “funds\\ninsufficient” on 13/2/2010. Thereafter legal notice was\\nissued to the accused calling upon him to pay the cheque\\namount. The accused refused to receive the notice and it\\nwas returned on 5/3/2010. Hence he has filed the\\nprivate complaint before III Addl.Civil Judge & J.M.F.C.\\nDharwad who taken the cognizance for the offences and\\nregistered the case as C.C.No.429/11.\\n3.

That the order of conviction and sentence\\npassed by the trial court is contrary to law\\nand facts and equities as it is liable to be\\nset aside.\\n2. That the trial court has not properly\\nappreciated the evidence and reasonings\\nhave not properly discussed.\\n3. The lower court wrongly held that the\\nclaimed amount in the complaint is legally\\nenforceable debt.\\n4. That the presumption held by the trial\\ncourt is against to the principles of natural\\njustice and trial court would have held the\\npoints for consideration in the negative.\\n5. That the trial court has not properly\\ninterpreted the provisions of section 138 of\\nNI Act.\\nand also urged other grounds as noticed in the appeal\\nmemo and prayed for setting aside the impugned\\njudgment/order of conviction.\\n6.

Before discussing the oral evidence of the\\ncomplainant/respondent, I would like to discuss the\\ndocumentary evidence produced by the\\ncomplainant/respondent. Ex.P.1 is the copy of the power\\nof attorney, Ex.P.2 is the ING Vyasya bank cheque\\nbearing No.198128 dated 4/2/2010 got issued by the\\naccused in favour of the complainant, Ex.P.3 is the memo\\nissued by the HDFC bank dated 13/2/2010, Ex.P.4 is\\nthe legal notice dated 22/2/2010 issued to the accused,\\nEx.P.5 is RPAD postal cover, Ex.P.5(a) legal notice,\\nEx.P.6 is the loan cum hypothecation agreement\\nexecuted between the parties, Ex.P.7 statement of loan\\naccount of accused and Ex.P.8 is complaint. On perusal\\nof the above said documents it is clear that the\\ncomplainant has complied the initial burden upon him.\\n12. To substantiate the documentary evidence, it is\\nnecessary to discuss the oral evidence. The GPA holder of\\nthe complainant himself examined as P.W.1 and got\\nmarked in all 8 documents who deposed before the trial\\ncourt on oath with reiterating the same as urged in the\\ncomplaint and notice. In his cross examination nothing\\nwas elicited to disprove the version of the complainant,\\nas urged either in the complaint or notice. On the other7 Crl. Appeal No.17/2014\\nhand the appellant/accused herein failed to enter into\\nthe witness box and put forth his specific defence. Mere\\ndenial of the case of the complainant while he was\\nexamined U/s.313 Cr.P.C. is not sufficient and even he\\nhas not at all stated anything in that time also.\\n13. So looking to the records available as well as\\njudgment of the trial court, I am of the view that the\\norder of conviction passed by the trial court against the\\naccused is appropriate and adequate. In the light of the\\nabove discussions, there seems no manifested error in\\nthe conclusions or in analyzing the evidence by the\\nlearned trial court. Thus I find no reason to interfere with\\nthe conviction recorded against the appellant/accused.\\nTherefore the grounds urged by the appellant is devoid of\\nmerits. Hence, without hesitation I answer the point No.1\\nin the negative and proceed to pass the following;\\nORDER\\nThe appeal filed by the appellant/accused is hereby\\ndismissed.\\nIt is further ordered that, the judgment/order of\\nconviction and sentence in C.C.No.429/2011 dated\\n20/12/2013 passed by the learned III Addl. Civil Judge\\nand J.M.F.C. Dharwad is hereby confirmed.8 Crl. Appeal No.17/2014\\nThat the appellant is on bail, who is directed to\\ncomply the order immediately. In default he shall\\nundergo sentence imposed upon him. On the failure of\\nthe appellant to surrender as above directed, the learned\\ntrial court shall commit the appellant for under going the\\nsentence by issuing warrant of arrest against him.\\nRecords of the court below be returned with a copy\\nof this order forthwith for compliance.\\n(Dictated to the Stenographer, computerized, same is\\ncorrected, signed and then pronounced by me on this the\\n31st day of October, 2015.)\\n(HOSAMANI SIDDAPPA .H.)\\nIV Addl.

These appeals arise out of the judgment and decree\\ndated 19.12.2009 passed in O.S. No.17/2002 on the file\\nof Principal Civil Judge (Sr.Dn), Hubli, challenging its\\ncorrectness under Section 96 R/w Order 41 Rule 1 CPC.\\n2. The defendant No.2 has preferred the R.A. No.18/2010,\\ndefendant No.1 has preferred R.A. No.23/2010,7 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\ndefendant No.3 has preferred R.A. No.24/2010 and\\ndefendants No.4 to 8 have preferred R.A. No.30/2010.\\n3. The parties would be referred to as per the ranks\\nassigned in the Trial Court.\\n4. The plaintiff–Abdul Majid Nadaf has filed the suit for\\ncancellation of the sale deed dated 28.1.1994 executed in\\nrespect of suit property by holding that the said\\ndocument is illegal, null and void and not binding on the\\nplaintiff; consequently to cancel the sale deeds dated\\n16.9.1994 and 5.3.1998 executed in respect of the suit\\nproperty by holding that the said documents illegal, null\\nand void and not binding on the plaintiff; consequently\\nthe defendants No.1 to 8 be restrained by an order of\\npermanent injunction from interfering with peaceful\\npossession and enjoyment of the suit property by\\nplaintiff; the copy of the decree be sent to Sub-Registrar\\nto make note about the cancellation of the instruments\\nin his books etc.8 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n5. The suit property is N.A. plot No.4 measuring 4 guntas\\n12 annas bearing R.S.No.604-D and HDMC Property\\nNo.604-D/4 situated in Ward No.12 of Unkal village\\nwith following boundaries i.e. to the east-Plot No.5,\\nWest- Plot No.3, North-road and south-Plot No.9 and\\n10.\\n6. The suit property is illegally included along with plots\\nNo.5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 of R.S.No.604-D of Unkal and a\\nnew Plot Number as 4+5+6+10+11+12 is given. The\\nplaintiff has purchased the suit property under two\\nregistered sale deeds dated 4.11.1985 and 12.12.1985\\nfrom Hanamanthappa Mahadevappa Hadimani and\\nothers for valuable consideration and after purchase his\\nname is entered in the concerned record of rights as\\nowner and kabjedar vide M.E.No.1042/A and 1044/A\\nand the name of the plaintiff is recorded in HDMC\\nrecord. Since the date of purchase he is in possession\\nand enjoyment of the same.\\n7. On 27.2.1999 he had been to HDMC for paying the\\nproperty tax in respect of the suit property and for the9 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nfirst time he came to know that his name had been\\ndeleted from the records and the name of other persons\\nwere recorded and he gave representation to the\\nCommissioner, Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation\\nto take proper action against the illegal deletion of his\\nname from the records by way of representations dated\\n12.3.1999 and 20.5.1999. He has also applied for\\nrelevant records. He came to know in or about May 1999\\nthat the first defendant has executed a registered sale\\ndeed on 28.1.1994 selling the suit property in favour of\\nthe second defendant and the first defendant falsely\\nrepresented himself to the Power of Attorney holder of\\nthe plaintiff but the plaintiff has never executed any\\nPower of Attorney at any point of time in favour of the\\nfirst defendant. He learnt that the second defendant has\\nexecuted another illegal sale deed on 16.9.1994 in favour\\nof the third defendant and the third defendant in turn\\nhas executed illegal sale deed on 5.3.1998 in favour of\\nthe defendants No.4 to 8 and all the sale deeds are\\nillegal, null and void and not binding on the plaintiff. He\\nhas also learnt that on the strength of illegal deeds10 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nM.E.No.2466, 3059 and 4608 have been effected behind\\nthe back and without the knowledge of the plaintiff and\\nthus, he filed an appeal in RTS:AP: 76/2001 before the\\nAssistant Commissioner Dharwad challenging the illegal\\nmutation entry and the said appeal is pending. Before\\nfiling of the suit, he came to know that the defendants\\nNo.4 to 8 in collusion with the Revenue Authorities got\\nincluded the present suit property with Plot Nos.5, 6, 10,\\n11 and 12 of R.S.No.604-D of Unkal and a new Number\\nas R.S.No.604-D and Plot Nos.4+5+6+10+11+12 is given\\nand M.E.No.5930 has been effected behind his back. It\\nis pleaded that the plaintiff is in actual possession of the\\nsuit property. He pleads that the first defendant appears\\nto have created some bogus and forged documents\\nstyled as Power of Attorney of the plaintiff and thus, he\\nhas executed an illegal sale deed dated 28.1.1994 in\\nfavour of the second defendant and in turn subsequent\\nsales have been made. The acts of the defendants\\namount to criminal offences. Since the sale deeds have\\nbeen created without the knowledge and behind the\\nback of the plaintiff they do not bind him. He sent a11 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nlegal notice on 28.11.2001 against all the defendants to\\ncancel the sale deeds and execute the appropriate deeds.\\nThe notices sent to defendants No.1 and 3 were returned\\nas not claimed, the notice sent to defendant No.2 has not\\nat all returned and the notice served on defendants No.4\\nto 8 but in vain.\\n8. The cause of action arose for the first time on 27.2.1999\\nwhen the plaintiff had been to HDMC and came to know\\nabout the deletion of his name from property register\\nand in the month of May 1999 when the plaintiff came to\\nknow that the first defendant has illegally executed the\\nsale deed on 28.1.1994 in favour of the second defendant\\nand the defendant No.2 in turn executed sale deed on\\n16.9.1994 in favour of the third defendant etc. He paid\\nthe Court fee on the consideration amount mentioned in\\nthe first sale deed dated 28.1.1994 under Section 38 of\\nKarnataka Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act and as\\nregards the other sale deeds under Section 6 of\\nKarnataka Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act.12 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n9. After registration of the suit, all the defendants have\\nentered appearance through counsel.\\n10. The first defendant filed his written statement at a\\nbelated stage and it was rejected.\\n11. The second defendant denies the contents of the plaint\\nincluding the description of the property and puts the\\nplaintiff for strict proof of the same.\\n12. The substantial defence is that before purchase\\nthoroughly he has verified the previous title of the\\nvendors and his predecessors and came to know that the\\nplaintiff had executed a Special Power of Attorney in\\nfavour of the first defendant who was his close relative\\nand it was dated 3.2.1988 and it is duly executed Power\\nof Attorney. Through Power of Attorney the plaintiff\\nauthorized the first defendant to deal with his property\\nand negotiate for selling it and to receive consideration\\namount etc. After satisfying himself, he has purchased\\nthe property from the first defendant under a registered\\nsale deed dated 28.1.1994 for consideration of13 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nRs.80,000/- and thereafter he has sold it in favour of\\nthird defendant on 30.9.1994 for consideration of\\nRs.90,000/- and in turn the third defendant has sold it\\nto defendants No.4 to 8 on 5.3.1998. According to him,\\nthe plaintiff has created an imaginary cause of action to\\nbring the suit within limitation. The suit is barred by\\ntime since the first sale deed is dated 28.1.1994 and this\\nfact was known to the plaintiff and still filed the suit\\nafter lapse of nearly 12 years. He pleads that he is\\nbonafide purchaser of the suit property for value and\\nwithout notice and the suit is filed to harass him.\\n13. The defendant No.4 has filed the written statement\\nwhich was adopted to by defendant No.3 and defendants\\nNo.5 to 8.\\n14. The defendant No.4 has also denied the entire contents\\nof the plaint and puts the plaintiff for the strict proof of\\neach and every averment made in the plaint. He also\\nclaims to be a bonafide purchaser for value. It is also\\npleaded that he has verified the previous title of the\\nvendors and their predecessors and came to know that14 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\non a duly executed Power of Attorney, the first\\ndefendant has sold the property in favour of the second\\ndefendant and in turn the second defendant has sold it\\nin favour of the third defendant and third defendant has\\nsold it to the defendants No.4 to 8. It is pleaded that the\\ndefendants No.1 and 2 before sale transaction had filed a\\ndeclaration under Urban Land Ceiling Act also. The\\ndefendants No.4 to 8 have purchased the suit property\\nfrom the third defendant for a valuable consideration of\\nRs.6,21,000/- and their names are recorded in the\\nconcerned records. As the market value increased, the\\nplaintiff has come up with a false suit. The defendants\\nNo.4 to 8 not only purchased the suit property but also\\nadjacent properties for valuable consideration and they\\nhave given application to the Urban Development\\nAuthority for amalgamation of Plot Nos.4, 5, 6, 10, 11\\nand 12 of R.S.No.604-D of Unkal village and the same\\nwas amalgamated as per the orders of the\\nCommissioner, Hubli-Dharwad Urban Development\\nAuthority on 6.11.1998 and thereafter they have given an\\napplication for conversion of the land use from15 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nIndustrial purpose to Commercial purpose by paying\\nnecessary conversion fees and the Development\\nAuthority has permitted the same by order dated\\n16.4.2001 and thereafter they have developed the land\\nwith an intention to make use of the land for commercial\\npurpose. Knowing all these facts the present suit has\\nbeen filed. It is pleaded that they are put in possession\\non the date of the sale deed and they plead that the suit\\nis barred by limitation and prayed for dismissal of the\\nsuit.\\n15. On the basis of the rival pleadings, the following issues\\nand additional issues are framed:\\n1. Whether 1st defendant was the P.A. Holder\\nof plaintiff? And as such sold suit plot to 2nd\\ndefendant on 28.01.1994 under Registered\\nDeed?\\n2. Whether defendants 2 to 8 had/have\\nacquired valid title over suit plot?\\n3. Whether suit is barred by limitation?16 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n4. Whether plaintiff is still in possession of suit\\nplot?\\n5. What order or decree?\\nADDL. ISSUE-1 FRAMED ON 2.1.2009:\\n1. Whether the defendant proves that the\\nCourt fee paid on the plaint is insufficient?\\nADDL. ISSUE FRAMED ON 7.9.2009:\\n1. Whether plaintiff proves that the 1st\\ndefendant had executed bogus, forged\\nPower of Attorney, though he had not\\nexecuted any Power of Attorney in favour of\\n1st defendant?\\n16. The plaintiff examined himself as P.W.1 and a witness as\\nP.W.2 and got marked 22 documents. The second\\ndefendant is examined as D.W.1, the defendant No.1 is\\nexamined D.W.3, defendant No.4 is examined as D.W.5\\nand two witnesses as D.Ws.2 and 4 and got marked 8\\ndocuments and closed the side.\\n17. After hearing both sides, the Trial Court decreed the suit\\nof the plaintiff.17 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n18. R.A. No.18/2010 is preferred by the second defendant\\ncontending that the impugned judgment and decree are\\ncontrary to law, pleadings of the case; proper issues are\\nnot framed and the issues framed do not spring from the\\npleadings; evidence is not properly appreciated and the\\nTrial Court committed error in answering additional\\nissue dated 2.1.2009 in the affirmative; proper Court fee\\nhas not been paid; after closure of the evidence, the\\nplaintiff was permitted to reopen the case and get some\\ndocuments marked but no opportunity was given to the\\ndefendants for leading further evidence and the\\napplication filed in this regard has been rejected; the\\nrejection of the application for filing written statement\\nof the first defendant is contrary to law and facts; the\\nTrial Court ought to have believed the execution of the\\nPower of Attorney as a valid execution; the laches on the\\npart of the plaintiff are not taken into consideration;\\nevidence is not properly appreciated; the Trial Court\\nshould have believed the evidence of D.W.4 who is\\nmember of the Bar; the Trial Court ought to have\\nappreciated the fact that the Power of Attorney was18 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nexecuted on 3.2.1988 and evidence was recorded in the\\nyear 2009 and minor discrepancies are bound to occur;\\nunnecessarily evidence of D.W.3 is disbelieved;\\nexamination of the notary is not necessary but the Trial\\nCourt has given importance for his non-examination;\\npresumption regarding registration of the document is\\nnot raised; the Trial Court ought to have disbelieved the\\nevidence of P.W.2 and should not have considered\\nEx.P.18 which was tampered with; the rulings are not\\nproperly appreciated; the Trial Court ought not have\\ncompared the signatures (admitted and disputed) and it\\nis against the principles laid down by the various\\ndecisions; the findings on issues are not proper; and\\nthus amongst other grounds prayed for allowing the\\nappeal.\\n19. The first defendant has challenged judgment and decree\\nin R.A. No.23/2010 contending that it is improper and\\nincorrect and it has not properly appreciated the\\npleadings and evidence; proper issues are not framed;\\nthe burden is erroneously shifted; proper presumptions19 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nof law is not raised; reasonings are not proper; the suit\\nshould have been dismissed as barred by time; the Trial\\nCourt ought to have held that the plaintiff is not in\\npossession of the suit property and amongst other\\ngrounds prayed for allowing the appeal.\\n20. R.A. No.24/2010 is preferred by the third defendant\\ncontending that the impugned judgment and decree are\\ncontrary to law and evidence; the Trial Court has not\\nconsidered the lapses on the part of the plaintiff and it\\nshould have been dismissed the suit as barred by time; it\\nerred incoming to the conclusion that there is collusion\\nbetween the defendants No.1 and 2 towards creation of\\nfabricated documents; the suit of the plaintiff without\\nseeking the cancellation of the Power of Attorney is not\\nat all maintainable and the Trial Court has lost sight of it\\nthough the Power of Attorney was valid; the Trial Court\\non flimsy grounds has come to different conclusion; no\\nopportunity was given for cross-examination of P.W.1\\nwith regard to Ex.P.21 and P.18, the Trial Court ought to\\nhave applied Section 17 of the Limitation Act and it has20 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nintroduced a new case; the attendance register pertains\\nto the Office of the Assistant Executive Engineer,\\nBagalkot Division but the plaintiff was working in Gokak\\nTaluk of Belgaum Division; the Trial Court should have\\nheld that for not filing criminal complaint against the\\nfirst defendant towards forgery of Power of Attorney, the\\nsuit is not maintainable; Ex.D.8 is not properly\\nappreciated and the plaintiff kept quiet when the\\nnotification was issued in Samyukta Karnataka Kannada\\ndaily by Hubli-Dharwad Urban Development Authority;\\nthe evidence of plaintiff is not cogent; the Trial Court\\nought to have dismissed the suit since he has not proved\\nhis possession and amongst other grounds prayed to\\nallow the appeal.\\n21.

No.30/2010 is preferred by the defendants No.4 to\\n8 contending that the impugned judgment is against the\\nlaw and facts; proper issues have not been framed and\\nanswered; the limitation aspect is not considered\\nproperly; Court fee paid is not proper; it was duty of the\\nplaintiff to have referred the Power of Attorney to21 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nexperts since he claims it is a forged one but the Trial\\nCourt has compared itself and came to wrong\\nconclusion; unnecessary importance is given to\\nAttendance Register and thus, amongst other grounds it\\nis prayed to allow the appeal.\\n22. After registration of the appeals, the plaintiff has entered\\nappearance through counsel.\\n23. Secured the Trial Court records.\\n24. Heard both sides.\\n25. The learned counsel for the appellant in R.A.\\nNo.18/2010 submitted that the plaintiff has executed\\nPower of Attorney in favour of the first defendant on\\n3.2.1988 and after six years the first defendant has sold\\nthe property to the second defendant for valuable\\nconsideration on the strength of the Power of Attorney\\nand the second defendant in turn sold it to third\\ndefendant on 16.9.1994 and the third defendant sold it\\nin favour of the defendants No.4 to 8 on 5.3.1998 and\\ndespite knowing the facts, the suit is filed on 21.12.200122 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nand thus, the suit is hopelessly barred by time. He\\nargued that Section 85 of the Indian Evidence Act\\nprovides for presumption in favour of the due and valid\\nexecution of Power of Attorney and though the Power of\\nAttorney is valid and duly executed, yet the Trial Court\\nhas come to a different conclusion on the basis of\\nAttendance Register which is not proved in accordance\\nwith law. He submitted that the Attendance Register\\nbelongs to a different Division and there is no pleading\\nin this regard in the plaint. He has relied upon the\\ndecision reported in AIR 1971 S.C. 761, AIR 1980 SC\\n1109, AIR 2004 SC 1990. He submitted that the\\nevidence of the learned Advocate who identified the\\nplaintiff during the execution of the Power of Attorney is\\ncogent and satisfactory and despite this, the Trial Court\\non flimsy grounds has disbelieved his evidence and\\nrelied upon the decisions reported in AIR 2002 Delhi\\n440 and AIR 1976 Allahabad 64. He took me through\\nthe prayer column in the plaint and submitted that the\\nmain relief should have been for the declaring the Power\\nof Attorney as null and void but the plaintiff has not23 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nsought for that relief and thus, the Trial Court should\\nhave dismissed the suit. He argued that as per Section 3\\nof the Transfer of Property Act, the registration of a\\ndocument itself is notice to all and when this is so, the\\nfirst sale deed has taken place in the year 1994 and the\\nsuit should have been filed within 3 years from the said\\ndate and thus, the suit is barred by time and prayed to\\nallow the appeal and he has relied upon the following\\ndecisions:\\n1. 1970 LawSuit (SC) 141 in the case of Jugraj Singh\\nVs. Jaswant Singh.\\n“Code of Civil Procedure ,1908 – Order,1,\\nRule 3 – Proper party – Non –joinder – Suit\\nfor redemption of mortgage – Deposit of\\nredemption money by son of Mortgagor –\\nTransfer of property by mortgagor to other\\nperson – Suit challenging transfer of\\nproperty – Non impleadment of son of\\nmortgagor while impleading transferee –\\nSuit is not properly framed and is liable to\\nfail.

There is a\\npresumption of regularity of official acts and\\nwe are satisfied that he must have satisfied\\nhimself in the discharge of his duties that the\\nperson who was executing it was the proper\\nperson.

Dy.Commissioner of Hazaribagh.\\n“6) This Court pointed out that in\\nview of the provisions of Order VI, R.8 and\\nOrder VIII, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil\\nProcedure , the appellant would be debarred\\nfrom raising the point for the first time before\\nthis Court or even before the High Court. The\\nfacts of the present case appear to be on all\\nfours with facts of the case in the decision\\ncited above. In the instant case also, the\\nappellant contended himself by relying on the\\nresolution by the Government, treated it as a\\nvalid arbitration agreement and never raised\\nthe question that the said resolution was hit\\nby Art, 299 of the Constitution of India. On\\nthe other hand, the appellant fully\\nparticipated in the arbitration proceedings\\nand having taken the benefit of a decision by\\nthe Board in his favour made a complete\\nsomersault only when the decision went26 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nagainst him, by taking the plea now under\\nexamination, which doubtless required\\ninvestigation of facts. Even that plea too he\\ntook neither before the Additional Sub –\\njudge in the High Court when the appeal was\\nheard on merits but only for the first time in\\nthe application which he gave for granting\\nleave to appeal to this Court. In these\\ncircumstances it is manifest that if the\\nappellant had raised the plea before the Trial\\ncourt that the arbitration agreement was not\\nin consonance with Article 299 of the\\nConstitution of India, the respondent may\\nhave been in a position to rebut the plea by\\nproducing evidence and circumstances to\\nshow that an agreement for arbitration was\\nauthenticated in the form required by Art.\\n299 of the Constitution. It is well settled that\\nno evidence can be looked into by the Court\\nfor which there is no foundation in the\\npleadings. We cannot therefore allow the\\nappellant to raise the plea for the first time in\\nthis Court and the High Court also ought not\\nto have entertained it at the stage of the\\napplication of a certificate if fitness to be\\ngranted for leave to appeal to this Court. No\\nother point was pleaded before us.27 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n3. AIR 1976 Allahabad 64 in the case of Mahadeo Nath\\nVs. Smt.

Learned counsel for the appellant in R.A. No.23/2010\\nadopted the above arguments and contended that the\\nfirst defendant is a co-brother of the plaintiff and in view\\nof the relationship, the plaintiff has executed Power of\\nAttorney in favour of the first defendant and since there\\nis inflation in the market value of the suit property, the\\nplaintiff has come up with this false suit and prayed to\\nallow the appeal.28 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n27. Learned counsel for the appellant in R.A. No.24/2010\\nargued that though the plaintiff has purchased the suit\\nproperty as per Ex.P.18 and P.19 on 4.11.1985 and\\n2.12.1985, he sleeps over the matter and remembers\\nabout the property only on 27.2.1999 and comes to pay\\nthe Municipal taxes and finds that his name is not found\\nand according to him it is totally unbelievable. He\\nargued that the plaintiff is an Engineer by profession\\nand he has not acted as a prudent man. Since he was in\\nneed of money for the marriage of his daughter, he has\\nexecuted Power of Attorney in favour of the first\\ndefendant and it is a valid Power of Attorney and\\naccordingly the first defendant has sold the property in\\nfavour of the second defendant for a valuable\\nconsideration. He argued that when the suit property\\nwas amalgamated with other properties, due notices\\nhave been issued by the competent authorities and still\\nthe plaintiff being an engineer keeps quiet and this fact\\nitself indicates that since the plaintiff has sold the\\nproperties through the first defendant and thus he kept\\nquiet. He took me through paragraph No.11 of the plaint29 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nand emphasized that the word used by the plaintiff is\\n“appears to have created some bogus and forged\\ndocuments styled as Power of Attorney of the plaintiff”\\netc and this fact itself indicates that the plaintiff was in\\nknow of the fact of execution of the valid Power of\\nAttorney. He argued that there is no evidence to show\\nthat the second defendant has colluded with the first\\ndefendant to grab the property. He argued that though\\nfirst defendant filed the written statement yet the Trial\\nCourt has rejected it without assigning proper reasons.\\nHe argued that the second defendant was bonafide\\npurchaser of the property for value and the Trial Court\\nhas not framed any issue with regard to the same. He\\nsubmitted the proviso appended to Section 17 of the\\nLimitation Act is attracted and the plaintiff has failed to\\ndisprove the same. He argued that the signatures found\\nin Ex.D.1 and P.19 are made by the plaintiff only but the\\nTrial Court without the opinion of the expert, came to a\\ndifferent conclusion. He took me through Ex.P.21 which\\nis sale agreement in favour of the plaintiff and it is the\\nfirst defendant who being the relative of the plaintiff was30 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nscribe for it and when the first defendant who is\\nexamined as D.W.3 has given evidence that the plaintiff\\nhas executed Power of Attorney in his favour, the Trial\\nCourt ought to have believed the same. He took me\\nthrough Ex.P.18 which is registered sale deed and\\nparticularly to the recital that an amount of Rs.12,500/-\\nwas already paid and nothing was due and yet P.W.1 has\\nstated in his evidence that he paid the amount in the\\npresence of the Sub-Registrar etc and thus, the conduct\\nof the plaintiff is not fair. He also argued that the\\nplaintiff has not put his signature on the sale deed\\nEx.P.18 and it is the vendor who has presented the said\\ndocument for registration and submitted that during the\\nsale deeds at Ex.P.18 and P.21 the plaintiff was not at all\\npresent. He submitted that the first defendant is the\\nscribe for Ex.P.18, P.19 and P.21 and thus, his evidence\\nshould be believed. He invited my attention to the\\nevidence of D.W.3 (first defendant) and argued that his\\nevidence has to be believed since he has stated on oath\\nthat the consideration amount was paid to the plaintiff.\\nHe invited my attention to Ex.D.5 the publication in31 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nSamyukta Karnataka daily issued by Hubli-Dharwad\\nUrban Development Authority inviting objections from\\nthe public that the suit property i.e. Plot\\nNo.4+5+6+10+11+12 would be converted from\\nindustrial use to commercial use and objections if any\\nmay be given and the plaintiff kept quiet and after\\npayment of huge conversion charges, they were\\nconverted and this shows the complicity of the plaintiff.\\nHe took me through the cross-examination of D.W.1\\nmade by the plaintiff and argued that there is no\\ncollusion in between the plaintiff and first defendant. He\\nsubmitted that the Power of Attorney has been executed\\nin the year 1988 and the first sale deed has taken place\\nin the year 1994 and thus, there cannot be any collusion\\nin between the defendants No.1 and 2. He argued that\\nthe execution of Power of Attorney is proved as it is\\nsuggested by the plaintiff as under:\\n“¥ÁªÀgÀ D¥ï DmÉÆ¤ðAiÀÄ£ÀÄß PÉÃªÀ® ¨ÀszÀævÉUÁV ªÀiÁvÀæ\\nªÀiÁrPÉÆqÀ°®è, DvÀ v£À Àß ªÀÄUÀ¼À ªÀÄzÀÄªÉ ªÀiÁqÀ¨ÉÃPÀÄ, ¥Áèl32 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nvÉUÉzÀÄPÉÆ¼Àî¨ÉÃPÀÄ CAvÁ ¸ÀzÀj ªÉÆQÛAiÀiÁg À ¥ÀvÀæ §gÉzÀÄ\\nPÉÆnÖgÀÄvÁÛ£É”\\nAnd thus, the Power of Attorney is valid. He argued that\\nafter purchase, the defendant No.3 got her name entered\\nin the concerned records as holder and she was in\\npossession of the same and paid Municipal taxes and after\\npurchase the defendants No.4 to 8 have paid the taxes etc\\nand being in possession, the taxes have been paid and still\\nthe Trial Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff has\\nproved his possession. He has relied upon the decisions\\nrendered in ILR 2005 Karnataka 884 and submitted that\\nthe Power of Attorney is duly valid. He argued that since\\nthere is no relief of cancellation of General Power of\\nAttorney, the suit is bound to be dismissed and prayed for\\nallowing the appeal and he has relied upon the following\\ndecisions:\\n1. The Limitation Act, 1963, Section 17:\\n“17.

Learned counsel for the appellants in R.A. No.30/2010\\ntook me through the prayer column and argued that the\\nmain relief should have been cancellation of the Power\\nof Attorney etc and submitted that the frame of the suit\\nitself is not proper.

He argued that when the plots were\\namalgamated, the plaintiff kept quiet and submitted that\\nas per Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act the suit\\nshould have been dismissed. He argued that Article 58 of\\nthe Limitation Act is not applicable since the plaintiff39 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nknew about the sale deed in the year 1994 etc. He relied\\nupon the decision reported in 2013(4) KCCR Short Note\\n308, 2000(7) SCC 702 and submitted to allow the\\nappeal.

Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the\\nplaintiff submitted that the plaintiff is the owner of the\\nsuit properties and when the plaintiff has specifically\\ndisputed the execution of the General Power of Attorney\\n(Ex.D.1) and when this is so, without proper proof, no\\npresumption as envisaged in Section 85 of the evidence\\nAct can be applied. He submitted that there is no\\nendorsement by the notary in Ex.D.1 that he had\\nsatisfied himself about the identity of the executant and\\nfurther no Serial Number of the Register is mentioned in\\nEx.D.1 and further the stamp vender’s Licence Number\\nis also absent and under these circumstances, Ex.D.1 is a\\nsuspected document and as such presumption cannot be\\ndrawn in favour of the defendants. In this regard he has\\nrelied upon the decisions reported in AIR 1997\\nKarnataka 275, AIR 1979 Bombay 202, ILR 2005\\nKarnataka 884. Further he argued that the plaintiff has\\nsummoned Attendance Register to prove that on the42 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\ndate of the alleged execution of Ex.D.1 he was on his\\nduties and this factum is proved by examining P.W.2\\nand thus, Ex.D.1 is not proved in accordance with law.\\nHe argued that he has not pleaded about the Attendance\\nRegister in the plaint and he has introduced the same in\\nevidence but no prejudice is caused to the defendants.\\nHe submitted that when the plaintiff has denied his\\nsignature on Ex.D.1, it was the duty of the defendants to\\nhave sent the admitted and disputed signatures of the\\nplaintiff to the hand-writing expert and as the\\ndefendants did not initiate any steps, the Court was\\njustified in comparing the signatures and arrived at a\\nconclusion and in this regard he has relied upon a\\ndecision reported in ILR 2007 Karnataka 247 and AIR\\n1962 Mysore 52 Head Note (C). In the alternate he\\nargued that whether Ex.D.1 is sufficient to register the\\nsale deed as there is no compliance of Section 32 and 33\\nof the Indian Registration Act and submitted that the\\nSub-Registrar should not have registered it and he has\\nrelied upon the decision reported in AIR 2009 SC 3077.\\nHe took me through the evidence of D.W.1 and argued43 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nthat the second defendant is not a bonafide purchaser of\\nthe suit property and he is hand in glove with the first\\ndefendant. He argued that when they have received\\nnotice Ex.P.6, they have not replied to the same and the\\nconduct of the defendants indicate that they are not\\nbonafide purchasers for value. He argued that the first\\ndefendant has sold the suit property for a paltry sum of\\nRs.80,000/- in favour of the second defendant but the\\nmarket value of the suit property was Rs.1,81,046/- and\\nthis fact itself indicates that the sale was not bonafide\\nand further it indicates collusion between defendants\\nNo.1 and 2. He submitted that as per Ex.D.3 again the\\nsuit property was sold for Rs.90,000/- and the market\\nvalue was around Rs.2 lakhs and no reasons are forth\\ncoming as to why the suit property was sold at a throw\\naway price. He argued that the defendants contend that\\nthere is collusion in between the first defendant and the\\nplaintiff and if this were to be true, they should not have\\nexamined the first defendant as D.W.3 and D.W.3 has\\ngiven unbelievable evidence and his written statement\\nhas been rejected. He submitted that even if the44 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nattendance register Ex.P.18 is left out from\\nconsideration, yet the evidence of the plaintiff is cogent.\\nHe submitted that the plaintiff is still in possession of\\nthe suit property and after purchase he had constructed\\na shed which is visible in Ex.P.20 and there is no\\nindependent evidence on behalf of the defendants to\\nshow their possession over the suit property. He argued\\nthat Ex.D.5 is only a paper notification and it is in small\\nletters and the paper i.e. Samyukta Karnataka has no\\ncirculation in Belgaum District and as such only on the\\nbasis of Ex.D.5, it cannot be said that the defendants are\\nin possession of the suit property. He argued that no title\\nhas passed in favour of the defendants and defendants\\nnot in possession of the suit property and thus, the\\nappeals are devoid of merits. He argued that Section 31\\nof the Specific Relief Act is attracted and he need not\\nseek the relief of declaration of title. He submitted that\\nthe plaintiff came to know about the illegal sale deeds\\nonly in the year 1999 when he had been to pay the\\nMunicipal taxes and thus, after knowing about the same\\nhas filed the suit within three years and as such the suit45 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nis well within time. He also argued that proper Court fee\\nhas been paid and prayed to dismiss all the appeals by\\nconfirming the judgment and decree. But he has not\\nsubmitted any of the decisions.\\n30. On the basis of rival arguments, the following points are\\nformulated for determination:\\n(1) Whether the plaintiff proves that the\\nfirst defendant has created a bogus and\\nforged Power of Attorney without his\\nconsent and as such the sale deed\\nexecuted by the first defendant in\\nfavour of the second defendant and\\nsubsequent sale deeds are liable to be\\ncancelled?\\n(2) Whether the plaintiff proves that he is\\nin possession of the suit property?\\n(3) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the\\nrelief of cancellation of sale deeds?\\n(4) Whether the defendants No.2 to 8 are\\nbonafide purchasers of the suit\\nproperty for value and further\\ndefendants No.4 to 8 prove that they\\nare in possession of the suit property?46 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n(5) Whether the judgment and decree of\\nthe trial Court require to be interfered?\\n(6) What order?\\n31. My answer to the above points are as under:\\nPoint No.1 : In the negative\\nPoint No.2 : In the negative\\nPoint No.3 : In the negative\\nPoint No.4 : In the affirmative\\nPoint No.5 : In the affirmative\\nPoint No.6 : As per final order for the\\nfollowing:\\nR E A S O N S\\nPOINTS No.1 TO 3 :\\n32. For convenient sake and to avoid repetition of\\ndiscussion of evidence, these points are taken together for\\ndiscussion.\\n33. The sum and substance of the plaint is that the plaintiff\\nhas purchased the suit property under a registered sale\\ndeed in the year 1985 and since then he is in possession47 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nand enjoyment of the same and on 27.2.1999 he had been\\nto the Office of HDMC for paying the property tax and\\ncame to know that his name had been deleted from the\\nconcerned records and name of another had been\\nsubstituted and further in the month of May 1999, he\\ncame to know that the first defendant has executed an\\nillegal registered sale deed on 28.1.1994 and sold it in\\nfavour of the second defendant on the strength of a bogus\\nand forged Power of Attorney and the defendants No.1\\nand 2 have colluded with each other in this regard and\\nthereafter the second defendant has sold it to defendants\\nNo.3 and defendant No.3 sold to defendants No.4 to 8 etc\\nand as such the sale deeds are liable to be cancelled etc.\\n34. The first defendant though entered appearance did not\\nfile written statement in time and on 7.11.2009 he filed\\nI.A. No.18 along with his written statement and sought for\\npermission to file written statement and on contest, the\\nsaid I.A. was dismissed. However, he is examined as\\nD.W.3.48 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n35. The second defendant has filed the written statement\\ncontending that he is a bonafide purchaser of the suit\\nproperty for value and the first defendant has executed a\\nvalid sale deed in his favour on the strength of Power of\\nAttorney Ex.D.1 executed by the plaintiff etc and as an\\nowner, he has executed the sale deed in favour of the third\\ndefendant on 16.9.1994 and the third defendant has\\nexecuted sale deed in favour of the defendants No.4 to 8\\non 5.3.1998 etc. The defendant No.4 has filed the similar\\nwritten statement.\\n36. Before analyzing the evidence, in my opinion, paragraph\\nNo.11 of the plaint is important to be reproduced as\\nunder:\\n“The plaintiff further submits that the\\ndefendant No.1 appears to have created some\\nbogus and forged documents styled as Power\\nof Attorney of the plaintiff and as, thus,\\nexecuted illegal sale deed dated 28.1.1994 in\\nrespect of suit property in favour of\\ndefendant No.2 mentioned above. The\\ndefendants No.1 and 2 in collusion with each\\nother have fabricated false and bogus49 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\ndocuments to engulf the suit property\\nbelonging to the plaintiff. Further the\\ndefendants No.3 to 8 mentioned above have\\nalso colluded with defendants No.1 and 2 and\\nhave thereby created false, bogus and illegal\\ndocuments. The plaintiff has reasonable\\napprehension that the said illegal documents\\nif left outstanding may cause him serious\\ninjury ……. Thus, the acts of the defendants\\nalso amount to criminal offences as per the\\nprovisions of Indian Penal Code. Hence the\\nplaintiff reserves his right to take criminal\\naction against the defendants separately”.\\n37. In paragraph No.6 of the plaint it is pleaded that :\\n“In fact the plaintiff has never executed any\\nPower of Attorney in favour of the defendant\\nNo.1 at any point of time. Further plaintiff\\nhas never authorized the defendant No.1 to\\ndeal in any manner in respect of suit\\nproperty”\\n38. It is pertinent to mention here only that there is no\\npleading in the plaint that the plaintiff had attended to his\\nduty in his Office at Mamdapur on 3.2.1988, on which\\ndate, it is alleged by the defendants that he had executed50 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nPower of Attorney as per Ex.D.1 by coming over to Hubli.\\nBut after closure of the evidence of both sides, the plaintiff\\nsummoned the attendance register and got examined\\nP.W.2. In my opinion, there should have been a pleading\\nabout the plaintiff having attended to his official duties on\\n3.2.1988 at Mamdapur. A great surprise has been caused\\nto the defendants.\\n39. The plaintiff as P.W.1 has filed affidavit evidence\\nreiterating the contents of plaint. Exs.P.1 and P.2 are the\\nRTC’s of plot No.4 and the name of the plaintiff appears\\nin column No.9 of Ex.P.1 and in Ex.P.2 the name of\\nsecond defendant is shown by rounding of the name of\\nplaintiff; Ex.P.2 was obtained on 17.6.1999; Ex.P.3 is the\\nRTC of the suit property and in column No.9 the names of\\ndefendants No.4 to 8 is shown and this document is\\nobtained on 30.9.1999; Ex.P.4 is the certified copy of the\\nsale deed executed by the first defendant in favour of the\\nsecond defendant dated 28.1.1994; Ex.P.5 is the certified\\ncopy of the sale deed dated 5.3.1998 executed by the third\\ndefendant in favour of defendants No.4 to 8; Ex.P.6 is the51 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nlawyers notice dated 28.11.2001; Ex.P.7 is the postal\\nreceipt; Exs.P.8 and P.9 are the returned postal covers;\\nExs.P.10 to P.14 are the postal acknowledgements;\\nEx.P.15 is the certified copy of the sale deed dated\\n16.9.1994 executed by the second defendant in favour of\\nthe third defendant; Ex.P.16 is the mutation extract\\ncertified in the year 1986 and the name of the plaintiff is\\nmentioned as purchaser of the suit property; Ex.P.17 is\\nthe mutation extract showing the names of defendants\\nNo.4 to 8 as owners of the suit property; Exs.P.18 and\\nP.19 are the original registered sale deeds in respect of\\nsuit property; Ex.P.20 is the photograph; Ex.P.21 is the\\nsale agreement and Ex.P.22 is the certified copy of the\\nsale deed in favour of the defendants No.4 to 8.\\n40. Ex.D.1 is the Power of Attorney; Ex.D.2 is the original\\nregistered sale deed dated 28.1.1994 executed by the first\\ndefendant in favour of the second defendant; Ex.D.3 is the\\noriginal sale deed dated 13.9.1994 executed by the second\\ndefendant in favour of the third defendant; Ex.D.4 is the\\nPower of Attorney executed by the third defendant in52 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nfavour of her husband to depose in the Court; Ex.D.5 is\\nthe paper notification issued by Hubli-Dharwad Urban\\nDevelopment Authority dated 2.1.2001 inviting objections\\nif any from the interested persons towards conversion of\\nIndustrial site into commercial site; Ex.D.6 is the cash\\nreceipt; Ex.D.7 is the map as per P.T. sheet and Ex.D.8 is\\nthe proceedings for amalgamation of plots.\\n41. The plaintiff has filed his affidavit evidence reiterating\\nthe contents of the plaint. He denies in the cross-\\nexamination that his wife and the wife of the first\\ndefendant are sisters. According to him he came to know\\nabout the sale of the suit property from his vendor but he\\ndoes not know his address etc. It is elicited that “ªÉÆzÀ®\\n¨ÁjUÉ CªÀgÀÄ vÁ®ÆPÀ PÀZÉÃj ªÀÄÄA¨sÁUÀzÀ°è £À£Àß EvÀgÀ ¸ÉßÃ»vÀgÉÆA¢UÉ\\nEzÁÝUÀ ¥ÀjavÀgÁzÀgÀÄ . . . . . . 1£ÉÃ ¥ÀæwªÁ¢ £Á£ÀÄ ¥ÁèlÄUÀ¼À£ÀÄß\\n¥ÀgÀZÉÃd ªÀiÁqÀÄªÁUÀ ¥ÀjavÀgÁzÀgÀÄ” We have to remember that\\nhe is the resident of Belgaum district and he has\\npurchased the sites at Hubli and he came to know about\\nthe sale of the sites by his vendor and for the first time he53 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nhad met his vendor near the Taluk Kacheri, Hubli but he\\ndoes not know the address etc.\\n42. It is also elicited that he had built a temporary shed but\\non perusal of Ex.P.20 which is the photograph, there is\\nshed constructed with cement walls. There is no pleading\\nin this regard. It is also elicited that in the year 1999 he\\ncame to know about the forgery done by the first\\ndefendant and yet he did not give notice or published\\nnotice in any newspaper cautioning the public not to\\npurchase the suit property etc and further he has not\\ninitiated any criminal action against the first defendant.\\nEx.D.1 Power of Attorney was confronted to him and he\\ndenied his signature. He denied that he has executed\\nPower of Attorney in favour of first defendant. He denied\\nthat defendants No.2 to 8 are the bonafide purchasers for\\nvalue etc. He does not know if the plots have been\\namalgamated after the defendants No.4 to 8 purchased\\nthe suit property and likewise the conversion order was\\npassed for conversion from industrial purpose to\\ncommercial purpose etc. Though exhaustively cross-54 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nexamined he denied all the suggestions. It is pertinent to\\nmention that in the entire examination-in-chief, the\\nplaintiff never states that on 3.2.1988 he had attended to\\nhis office work at Mamdapur and he had not come to\\nHubli and as such, Power of Attorney Ex.D.1 is forged and\\nfabricated by the first defendant.\\n43. P.W.2 Mr. Shanmukappa Diggur is the Asst Executive\\nEngineer working in GRBC Right Bank Canal, Mamdapur\\nand he has produced Attendance register Ex.P.18 and he\\nidentified the signature of the plaintiff at Ex.P.18(b). He\\nstates that the working hours is from 10.30 a.m. to 1.15\\np.m. and 1.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. In the cross-examination\\nit is elicited that he is working as Assistant Executive\\nEngineer in Mamdapur since 2004 and he has no\\npersonal knowledge about the signature of the plaintiff at\\nEx.P.18(b) and he was not present at that time. He admits\\nthat the first two pages of the attendance register are\\nnewly pasted. He admits that Mamdapur does not come\\nin Bagalkot division but it is written on the first four pages\\nof Ex.P.18 that it is in Bagalkot Sub-Division etc. He55 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nadmits that “ ºÁdgÁwAiÀÄ°è N.r. JAzÀÄ £ÀªÀÄÆ¢¹ vÀªÀÄä ªÉÊAiÀÄQÛPÀ\\nPÉ®¸ÀUÀ½UÉ ºÉÆÃUÀ§ºÀÄzÀÄ JAzÀgÉ ¸Àj.” He admits that there are\\nsome alterations pertaining to the attendance of the\\nplaintiff. He denied other suggestions. In my opinion, the\\nevidence of P.W.2 will not help the plaintiff to prove that\\nhe had worked on 3.2.1988 at Mamdapur. As indicated\\nearlier there is no pleading in this regard.\\n44. D.W.3 Hazaratali Doddamani is the first defendant. As\\nindicated earlier he did not file written statement within\\nthe time prescribed by law and his request for written\\nstatement was rejected. According to the plaintiff this\\nwitness has forged and fabricated the Power of Attorney.\\nHe states in examination-in-chief that the plaintiff is his\\ndistant relative etc. He states that he had acted as\\nmediator in the sale transaction between the plaintiff and\\none Mr. Hadimani in respect of suit property. The sale\\nagreement is marked as Ex.P.21. He states that at the time\\nof sale agreement, no plots were formed. He also states\\nthat he is the scribe for the two sale deeds Exs.P.18 and\\nP.19 and according to him, he paid Rs.25,000/- to the56 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nplaintiff and the plaintiff has executed Power of Attorney\\nas security. He identified the signature of the plaintiff on\\nthe Power of Attorney at Ex.D.1 (a) and states that Mr.\\nNadimulla Advocate identified the plaintiff before the\\nNotary etc. He states that on the strength of the Power of\\nAttorney he has sold the suit property to the second\\ndefendant etc.\\n45. In the cross-examination it is elicited that Smt. Halimabi\\nis the aunt of the plaintiff and Smt. Sakkarbi is the aunt of\\nthe witness and they belonged to different villages. He\\ndenied that there is no relationship between the above\\ntwo women. It is pertinent to mention here only that there\\nis no specific denial of the fact that the plaintiff is not the\\ndistant relative of the first defendant. It is elicited that he\\nhas given evidence in good number of cases. It is also\\nelicited that there is no record to show the payment of\\nmoney by him to the plaintiff and the witness clarified\\nthat no record was obtained on account of the trust\\nbetween them. It is elicited that “ ¥ÁªÀgÀ D¥ï DmÉÆ¤ðAiÀÄ£ÀÄß\\nPÉÃªÀ® ¨ÀszÀævÉUÁV ªÀiÁvÀæ ªÀiÁrPÉÆqÀ°®è, DvÀ vÀ£Àß ªÀÄUÀ¼À ªÀÄzÀÄª É57 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nªÀiÁqÀ¨ÉÃPÀÄ, ¥Áèl vÉUÉzÀÄPÉÆ¼Àî¨ÉÃPÀÄ CAvÁ ¸ÀzÀj ªÉÆQÛAiÀiÁgÀ ¥ÀvÀæ §gÉzÀÄ\\nPÉÆnÖgÀÄvÁÛ£É” This elicitation destroys the theory of plaintiff.\\nThis has not been specifically denied by the plaintiff in the\\nfurther cross-examination. It is also elicited that he\\nintroduced the plaintiff to Mr. Nadimulla Advocate and\\nthe said Advocate identified him before the Notary. He\\nadmits that the stamp paper for the Power of Attorney\\nwas purchased by Sri. M.H. Shaikh on behalf of the\\nplaintiff. He denied that on 3.2.1988 the plaintiff was in\\nhis office and had not come to Hubli etc., but no where\\nthe plaintiff has deposed in his evidence that on 3.2.1988\\nhe was on his duties at Mamdapur. He denied that he has\\nforged the signature of the plaintiff and he has committed\\nan offence etc. He denied that in collusion with the second\\ndefendant, Ex.D.2 sale deed is created. He denied all\\nother suggestions.\\n46. D.W.4 Mohammed Hussain Nadimulla is an Advocate\\nby profession and he has identified the plaintiff before the\\nnotary towards execution of the Power of Attorney Ex.D.1.\\nIt is elicited in his cross-examination that he was junior58 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\ncolleague of Mr. M.R. Mulla and both the plaintiff and the\\nfirst defendant were attending the said office in respect of\\na dispute and thus, he was acquainted with them. He\\ndenied that he does not know the plaintiff and he is a\\nparty to the creation of Ex.D.1. If D.W.4 is a party to\\nforgery, the plaintiff could have taken action against him.\\n47. The second defendant is examined as D.W.1. He states\\nthat after purchase of the property he got his name\\nentered in the record of rights and he is bonafide\\npurchaser etc. It is elicited in the cross-examination that\\nhe had verified the property extract and original sale deed\\nof the plaintiff etc and further was satisfied with the\\nsignatures of the plaintiff on Power of Attorney and the\\nsale deed. He denied that he is not bonafide purchaser for\\nvalue. He admits that he has not taken the original sale\\ndeeds after his purchase. It is elicited that “ £Á£ÀÄ £À£Àß RjÃ¢\\n¥ÀvÀæzÀ°è AiÀiÁªÀÅzÉÃ ªÀåªÀºÁgÀ E®èzÉÃ PÁ®à¤PÀªÁV PÀæAiÀÄ ¥ÀvÀæzÀ ªÉÆvÀÛ\\n80,000.00 gÀÆ¥Á¬ÄUÀ¼ÀÄ JAzÀÄ vÉÆÃj¹zÉÝÃ£É J£ÀÄßªÀzÀÄ ¸ÀjAiÀÄ®è. ¤.r.1\\n¥ÀvÀæPÉÌ AiÀiÁgÀÄ, AiÀiÁªÁUÀ, J°è ¸À» ªÀiÁrzÀgÝ ÀÄ JAzÀÄ £Á£ÀÄ ¸ÀévÀB59 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n£ÉÆÃr®è JAzÀgÉ ¸Àj.” This elicitation destroys the theory of\\nthe plaintiff that there was collusion between the\\ndefendants No.1 and 2 interse and when this is so, it is\\nprobable that the second defendant was a bonafide\\npurchaser for value. He denied that the plaintiff is in\\npossession of the suit property.\\n48. D.W.2 Rajendra Wale is the Power of Attorney Holder of\\nthe third defendant and he claims that the third defendant\\nis bonafide purchaser for value.\\n49. D.W.5 is Mallikarjun Vantamuri and he is defendant\\nNo.4. He states that after purchase of the suit property\\nthey have taken steps to develop the sites bearing Nos.4,\\n5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 for conversion from Industrial to\\ncommercial use etc. He denied that he is not in possession\\nof the suit property. He denied that amalgamation is\\nshown only in papers and in fact it has not been done. It is\\nelicited that “ CªÀÄ®UÀªÉÄÃ±À£ï ªÀiÁrzÀ DgÀÄ ¥ÁèlÄUÀ¼À£ÀÄß £ÀAvÀgÀ\\nMqÉzÀÄ ªÀiÁgÁl ªÀiÁrzÉÝÃ£É JAzÀgÉ ¸ÀjAiÀÄ®è. zÁªÁ D¹ÛAiÀÄ£ÀÄß »gÉÃªÀÄoÀ\\nC£ÀÄßªÀ M§âjUÉ ªÀiÁgÁl ªÀiÁrzÉÝÃ£É.” He denied that Exs.D.760 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nand D.8 have been created behind the back of the\\nplaintiff. As per examination-in-chief, the suit property\\nwas sold to Mr. M.M.Hiremath and Mr. A.S.Katwe in the\\nyear 2003 and they are put in possession of the suit\\nproperty. Of course the sale has taken place after filing of\\nthe suit. The purchasers i.e. Mr. M.M. Hiremath and Mr.\\nA.S. Katwe are not made parties to the proceedings after\\ncoming to know about the sales.\\n50. Considering the admission given by P.W.2 that he has\\nno personal knowledge about the plaintiff putting his\\nsignature in the attendance register on 3.2.1988, it can be\\nsaid that the contents of Ex.P.18 attendance register and\\nEx.P.18(a) is not proved in accordance with law. If Ex.P.18\\nis left out from the purview, there remains the interested\\nevidence of the plaintiff alone. It is a fact that he has\\ndenied his signature on Ex.D.1 but D.W.3 and D.W.4 have\\ncategorically stated in their evidence that it was the\\nplaintiff who had put his signature in Power of Attorney\\nEx.D.1. Ex.D.1 is executed before a Notary and as per\\nSection 85 of the Indian Evidence Act, the Court can draw61 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\npresumption of its due execution. In my opinion, there are\\nno grounds to disbelieve the evidence of D.Ws.3 and 4.\\nWe have to remember that D.W.4 is a practicing Advocate\\nat Hubli and without there being any material on record,\\nthe Court cannot brush aside his evidence. Likewise no\\nenmity is proved in between the plaintiff and the first\\ndefendant so as to make the evidence of D.W.3 as not\\ncredit worthy. According to the plaintiff the first\\ndefendant is unknown to him and if this is to be believed,\\nhow the first defendant came to know about the plot\\nnumbers, name of the plaintiff etc goes unexplained. In\\nfact the defendants have discharged their burden by\\nexamining D.Ws.3 and 4 and the burden has shifted on\\nthe plaintiff to disprove the same and except the\\ninterested evidence of plaintiff, there is nothing on record\\nto rebut the presumption as provided under Section 85 of\\nthe Indian Evidence Act.\\n51. Learned counsel for the plaintiff vehemently argued that\\nthere is no endorsement of the Notary that he was\\nsatisfied as to the identity of the executant, no serial62 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nnumber of the register is mentioned, stamp vendors\\nLicence number is absent etc.\\n52. It is the plaintiff who has approached the Court and it is\\nfor him to prove that the alleged Power of Attorney Ex.D.1\\nis forged and fabricated. In my opinion, except the\\nevidence of plaintiff there is nothing on record. Even the\\nconduct of the plaintiff is questionable in the sense he\\ncame to know about the execution of the first sale deed in\\nthe month of February 1999 and yet he keeps quiet till\\nDecember 2001 without taking any action against the first\\ndefendant who is said to have forged and created the\\nPower of Attorney. On perusal of the Exs.P.2 and P.3\\nwhich are RTC extracts, they were obtained in the year\\n1999 only and yet, for the reasons best known to the\\nplaintiff, he keeps quiet. This is a strange thing. It is not\\nnormal behaviour of a prudent man.\\n53. It is pertinent to mention here that the plaintiff has not\\nsought for cancellation of the alleged Power of Attorney\\nEx.D.1. In my opinion, plaintiff is not sure about the\\nforgery and fabrication of Power of Attorney since he63 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nhimself has pleaded in paragraph No.11 of the plaint that\\n“the defendant No.1 appears to have created some bogus\\nand forged documents styled as Power of Attorney of the\\nplaintiff”. The word used is “appears” and that itself\\nindicates the uncertainty on the part of the plaintiff. The\\nApex Court in the case of Pyarelal Bhargav Vs. State\\nof Rajasthan reported in AIR 1963 Supreme Court\\n1094 has interpreted the word “appears” as “seems”. It\\nimparts a lesser degree of probability than proof and in\\nmy opinion, there is no specific denial in this regard by\\nthe plaintiff. Assuming for the sake of argument that the\\nsale deeds are liable to be cancelled and yet the Power of\\nAttorney remains intact and no purpose would be served.\\nIn my opinion, without cancellation of the Power of\\nAttorney, no relief can be granted.\\n54. It is well settled principle of law that cancellation can\\nonly be at the instance of a party who has executed the\\ninstrument which is void or voidable so far as he is\\nconcerned. If the document is one executed by a third\\nparty, the plaintiff has to show that it casts a cloud upon\\nhis title. In the present case on hand more than three sale64 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\ndeeds have taken place and they are duly registered. The\\nCourt can raise presumption as to valid execution of the\\nregistered documents. According to the sale deeds sought\\nto be cancelled now, possession has been delivered to the\\npurchasers. In my opinion, rightly or wrongly the title and\\npossession has been conveyed in favour of the purchasers.\\nThere is presumption that a registered document is\\nvalidly executed and so a registered document is prima\\nfacie valid in law. The person who challenges it has to\\nrebut the presumption since title has passed in favour of\\ndefendants and the defendants have specifically denied\\nthe title and possession of plaintiff over the suit property\\nand rival title is set up.\\n55. Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act refers to both void\\nand voidable documents. It is well settled principle of law\\nthat a document which is void, ab-initio need not be set\\naside since it is non-est in the eye of law. It is also a well\\nsettled principle of law that when the title of the plaintiff\\nis in cloud, declaration of title is to be sought by the\\nplaintiff. In the case on hand, the title of the plaintiff over65 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nthe property has been denied by the defendants and they\\nhave set up title in themselves and when this is so, the\\nrelief of cancellation can not be granted.\\n56. “Section 31 of Specific Relief Act in Chapter-V and\\nSection 34 in Chapter-VI operate in different fields. The\\noption is given to the plaintiff either to seek the relief\\nunder Section 31 or under Section 34. The reason is, the\\nword used in Section 31 is ‘may’ and it ends by saying the\\ncancelled deed has to be delivered up. To whom is the\\nquestion? It is for the plaintiff to decide whether he has\\ngot any apprehension of mischief or injury by the so-\\ncalled instrument. If the plaintiff is not a party to such an\\ninstrument, he can simply ignore the same and sue for\\ndeclaration of his title. If there is question of rival title,\\nthe plaintiff can sue for declaration under Section 34\\nwith the consequential relief “ (extracted from page 497 in\\nthe decision rendered by the Hon'ble High Court of\\nKarnataka, Bangalore in the case of D. Ramkrishna Vs.\\nD. Balkrishna (since dead by his L.Rs. and others)\\nand reported in 2015 (5) Kar.L.J. 478).66 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n57. In the case on hand, the defendants No.2 to 8 have set\\nup rival title in themselves and when this is so, without\\ndeclaring the so-called Power of Attorney Ex.D.1 as forged\\nor fabricated and null and void, the plaintiff may not be\\nentitled for the relief of cancellation of the sale deeds. As\\nindicated earlier there is no cogent evidence with regard\\nto the forgery and fabrication of the Power of Attorney by\\nthe first defendant. The matter would have been different\\nhad the plaintiff proved the above at least by\\npreponderance of probability. At the cost of repetition it\\nis to be stated that there is no pleading or evidence of\\nplaintiff that on 3.2.1988 he had attended to his official\\nduties at Mamdapur and the evidence of P.W.2 with\\nregard to the presence of the plaintiff on 3.2.1988 at\\nMamdapur discharging his official duty cannot be\\nbelieved since P.W.2 assumed the charge at Mamdapur\\nsince 2004 and thus, the evidence of P.W.2 will not prove\\nthe contents of Ex.P.18 the attendance register.\\n58. It is held in AIR 1984 NOC 80 (Andhra Pradesh) in the\\ncase of Vemula Maniamma Vs. Allugada\\nVenkatamma and others :67 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n“Specific Relief Act (47 of 1963), Section 31 –\\nCancellation of instruments – Who can sue\\nfor cancellation.\\nSection 31 does not give a right to sue to\\nall persons for cancellation. The Section\\ndescribes the class of persons who are given\\nthe right to sue for cancellation of the written\\ninstrument and the circumstances in which\\nthey can so sue for cancellation. Such right is\\navailable only to persons who have a\\nreasonable apprehension that such\\ninstrument if left outstanding may cause him\\nserious injury and against whom a written\\ninstrument is void or voidable.\\nWhere the sale deeds, the cancellation\\nof which was sought, were documents\\nexecuted by third parties in assertion of\\nhostile independent title claimed by the\\nvendors under those documents, held that the\\nplaintiff’s suit for cancellation of the\\ndocuments was not maintainable. Plaintiff\\nshould have filed the suit for declaration of\\nher title and consequential reliefs. AIR 1960\\nMad 1 (FB), Rel. on.”68 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n59. Except Ex.P.1 RTC, there is nothing on record which\\nclearly indicates the possession of the plaintiff over the\\nsuit property. At least he should have examined the\\nneighbouring persons to prove his possession. Though, he\\nhas stated in his evidence that he had constructed a\\ntemporary shed in the suit property, the evidence is silent\\nwhen it was constructed etc. Merely on the basis of\\nEx.P.20 photograph, it cannot be said that the plaintiff is\\nin possession of the suit property. The conduct of the\\nplaintiff is also important. As per the pleadings he came to\\nknow about the deletion of his name from the records on\\n27.2.1999 when he visited HDMC office for paying the\\nproperty tax. Thus, it can be said that he came to know\\nabout the deletion of his name on 27.2.1999. Exs.P.1 to\\nP.3 the RTC’s were obtained by him in the month of\\nSeptember 1999 and when this is so, notice as per Ex.P.6\\nwas got issued only on 28.11.2001 and no explanation is\\noffered for inaction on the part of the plaintiff for nearly\\nmore than 2 years. No reasons are forth coming as to why\\nthe plaintiff has not initiated suitable action against the\\nfirst defendant who according to the plaintiff has forged69 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nand fabricated Power of Attorney and likewise when\\naccording to the plaintiff, he had not come to Hubli on\\n3.2.1988 and executed Ex.D.1, he could have taken action\\nagainst Mr. Nadimulla Advocate who identified the\\nplaintiff.\\n60. Ex.D.5 is the paper publication issued by Hubli-\\nDharwad Urban Development Authority seeking objection\\nfrom the interested persons towards conversion from\\nIndustrial use to commercial use in respect of plot\\nNos.4+5+6+10 +11 +12 of R.S.No.604D of Unakal village.\\nThe learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff argued\\nthat the alleged publication was made in Samyukta\\nKarnataka, Hubli edition and the said newspaper has no\\ncirculation in Belgaum district. Regarding circulation of\\nthe said paper, the plaintiff has not given any evidence.\\nEven otherwise Hubli-Dharwad Urban Development\\nAuthority is a Government Institution and no malafides\\ncan be attributed. Though the plaintiff has purchased the\\nproperty in the year 1985, it appears he has not paid\\nproperty tax up to 1999 and for the first time he visits70 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nHDMC office on 27.2.1999 and in my opinion, this is a\\nstrange conduct on the part of the plaintiff. As per Ex.D.7\\nP.T. sheet Map, the plot Nos. 4+5+6+10+11+12 have been\\namalgamated and it was approved as per Ex.D.8 and\\nconversion order has been passed. All the above facts\\nclearly indicate that the plaintiff is not in possession of the\\nsuit property and when this is so, without seeking the\\nrelief of possession, the plaintiff is not entitled for the\\nreliefs.\\n61. As regards the defects in Ex.D.1 Power of Attorney, the\\nsame could have been appreciated had the plaintiff\\nproved forgery and fabrication of Ex.D.1 by the first\\ndefendant. He has relied upon a decision reported in AIR\\n1997 Karnataka 275. It is pertinent to mention that in\\nparagraph No.9 of the said judgment the Hon'ble High\\nCourt has observed” to avoid invalidation of the acts\\nalready done, the directions contained herein shall be\\neffective prospectively”. We have to remember that Ex.D.1\\ncame into existence on 3.2.1988 and thus, the said\\ndecision is not applicable.71 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\n62. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has also pressed\\ninto service the decision reported in ILR 2005 Karnataka\\n884 and argued that presumption operates in favour of\\nthe party relying on a document, provided he must prove\\nthe document is duly executed and authenticated. There is\\nno dispute about the proposition of law. Ex.D.1 is\\nnotarized and it bears the seal and signature of the notary.\\nAn Advocate of the bar (D.W.4) has identified the\\nexecutant. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied\\nupon a decision reported in AIR 1979 Bombay 202 which\\nis referred in ILR 2005 Karnataka 884. Considering the\\nabove, in my opinion, presumption under Section 85 of\\nIndian Evidence Act can be drawn.\\n63. Be that as it may, it is held in AIR 1967 Punjab and\\nHaryana 345.\\n“(A) Evidence Act (1872), Section 85 –\\nPower of Attorney – Presumption –\\nAuthentication by Notary Public – Procedure\\n– No particular form of authentication by\\nNotary Pubic is given under Section 85 –72 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nNotary Public need not use the word\\n“authentication” in the attestation made by\\nhim on the document – Attestation by Notary\\nPublic stating “subscribed and sworn to\\nbefore me” is valid authentication”.\\n64. The principles laid down in AIR 1971 SC 761 in the case\\nof Jugarajsingh and another Vs. Jaswantsingh\\nand others is also attracted to the facts on hand.\\n65. It is held in AIR 2007 Kerala 269 in the case of K.A.\\nPradeep Vs. Branch Manager, Nedungadi Bank\\nLimited, Manjeri and others” as under:\\n(A) Evidence Act (1 of 1872), S. 85 –\\nPresumption as to powers of attorney – Is\\nregarding both execution and authentication by\\nNotary – Document bears seal of Notary –\\nUnsatisfactory endorsement by Notary,\\nimmaterial – Not obligatory that Power of\\nAttorney should be attested by two witnesses.\\nThe presumption under Section 85 is\\nregarding both execution and authentication in\\nrespect of all documents which purport to be\\nPower of Attorney executed before and\\nauthenticated by the Notary public. As for the73 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nPower of Attorney in hand, though the\\nendorsement made by the Notary is\\nunsatisfactory, it cannot be said that the\\ndocument is not a document which purports to\\nbe a Power of Attorney executed before and\\nauthenticated by a Notary public. Significantly\\nthe document bears the seal of the Notary. Non-\\nattestation by witnesses will not be fatal to the\\nPower of Attorney since it is not at all obligatory\\nthat a Power of Attorney should be attested by\\ntwo witnesses. What is necessary is only its\\nauthentication”.\\n66. The principles laid down in AIR (37) 1950 Allahabad 524\\nin the case of Wali Mohammed Choudry and others\\nVs. Jamaluddin Choudry are also attracted.\\n67. It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the Trial Court\\nby comparing the admitted and disputed signatures of the\\nplaintiff has came to the conclusion that Ex.D.1(a) is not\\nthe signature of the plaintiff and thus, decreed the suit\\nand as such the findings should not be disturbed. As\\nagainst it the learned counsel appearing for the appellants\\nargued that the Trial Court should not have ventured into74 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\ncomparing the signatures since it is not an expert and as\\nsuch the Trial Court erred in this regard.\\n68. It is the fact that the Trial Court has compared the\\nsignatures. In my opinion, the Court should not take up\\nthe responsibility of comparing the disputed signature or\\nhandwriting with the admitted signatures or handwriting\\nunless a report is solicited from the expert since such an\\nexamination requires a scientific exercise.\\n69. In the case on hand, in my opinion, presumption as\\nenvisaged in Section 85 of the Indian Evidence Act is to be\\nraised in respect of Ex.D.1 the Power of Attorney. It is\\nrebuttable presumption. The defendants have examined\\nnot only the holder of the Power of Attorney but also the\\nAdvocate who identified the executant and thus,\\ndischarged the proof. To rebut the presumption, except\\nthe evidence of plaintiff who denies his signature on\\nEx.D.1, there is nothing on record. As indicated earlier the\\nevidence of P.W.2 cannot be believed and in my opinion,\\nthere is no rebuttal evidence in the strict sense. If really75 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nEx.D.1(a) was not the signature of the plaintiff, in my\\nopinion, he could have filed an application under Section\\n73 of the Evidence Act requesting the Court to refer the\\nadmitted and disputed signatures to the handwriting\\nexpert. This could have served his purpose. The plaintiff\\nhas not initiated any steps in this regard and under these\\ncircumstances, in my opinion, the comparison of the\\nsignatures by the Court itself, is not correct and thus, the\\nargument is repelled.\\n70. It was also argued that the Court suo-motu cannot send\\nthe admitted and disputed signatures for expert’s opinion.\\nThere is no dispute about the proposition of law. As\\nindicated above, in fact, it was necessary for the plaintiff\\nto have sent it to the expert and thus, argument is\\nrepelled.\\n71. The learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that Section\\n32 and 33 of the Indian Registration Act are not complied\\nwith and the Sub-Registrar ought not have registered the\\nsale deeds etc and in this regard he pressed into service76 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nthe decision of the Apex Court in the case of Suraj\\nLamps and Industries Private Limited Vs. State of\\nHaryana. There is no dispute about the prposition of\\nlaw. It is held in Head Note-A as under:\\n“(A) Transfer of Property Act, 1882 –\\nSections 54 and 55 – Powers of Attorney Act\\n1882 – Section 1A and 2 – Indian Succession\\nAct, 1925, Sections 69 and 70 – Sale\\nagreement/ General Power of Attorney/ Will\\ntransfers – Legality and validity of – Sale\\nagreement / General Power of Attorney/Will\\ntransaction does not convey any title nor\\ncreate any interest in an immovable property\\n– Such transactions may be used to obtain\\nspecific performance or to defend possession\\nunder Section 53A of the Transfer of Property\\nAct – HELD: These observations are not\\nintended to affect the validity of sale\\nagreements and proof of attorney executed in\\ngenuine transactions”\\n72. The said principle could have been applicable had the\\nplaintiff proved the General Power of Attorney Ex.D.1 as\\nforged and fabricated. Since he has not proved the forgery77 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nor fabrication of Ex.D.1, the said decision is not\\napplicable. Thus, argument is repelled.\\n73. It was argued by the appellants that the suit is not filed\\nwithin time. In my opinion, from 27.2.1999, the suit is\\nfiled within 3 years and it is in time. There is no dispute\\nregarding the principles laid down in 2000 Law Suit SC\\n1425 in the case of Dilboo Vs. Dhanrajedevi = 2000\\n(7) SCC 702.\\n74. We have to bear in mind that the plaintiff is resident of\\nBelgaum district and the first sale deed was registered in\\nthe office of the Sub-Registrar, Hubli. As per the\\npleadings and evidence the plaintiff came to know about\\nthe deletion of his name from Municipal records on\\n27.2.1999 and in my opinion, that is the date of\\nknowledge and the suit is filed on 21.12.2001 and thus, it\\nis within time. Hence the arguments are over-ruled.\\n75. Thus, considering all the above, I answer the points No.1\\nto 3 in the negative and against the plaintiff.78 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nPOINT No.4:\\n76. The defendants No.2 to 8 claim to be the purchasers of\\nthe suit property for value. It has come in the evidence of\\nsecond defendant that he had verified the Power of\\nAttorney etc and purchased the property. As on the date\\nof the sale deed there was nothing to indicate that the\\nPower of Attorney Ex.D.1 was forged or fabricated. Even\\nduring the trial the plaintiff has not proved that the Power\\nof Attorney Ex.D.1 is forged or fabricated and the Court\\nhas raised the presumption under Section 85 of the\\nIndian Evidence Act with regard to it. When this is so, it\\ncan be said that the second defendant was the bonafide\\npurchaser and likewise subsequent purchasers are the\\nbonafide purchasers for value. The plaintiff has miserably\\nfailed to prove that fraud has been committed on him by\\nthe first defendant. Apart from this, the principle of\\npossession follows title is applicable and further\\ndefendants No.4 to 8 after purchase have got\\namalgamated the suit property with other adjacent\\nproperties and further they have obtained conversion79 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\norder from Industrial use to Commercial use. Thus,\\nconsidering the totality of the evidence and\\ncircumstances, point No.4 is answered in the affirmative\\nand in favour of the defendants No.2 to 8.\\nPOINT No.5:\\n77. I have perused the impugned judgment and decree. I\\nhave reappraised the evidence. In my opinion, the\\nplaintiff is uncertain about the forgery and fabrication of\\nthe Power of Attorney made by the first defendant and\\nparagraph No.11 of the plaint speaks volumes of it. Apart\\nfrom this, the Trial Court has failed to raise presumption\\nunder Section 85 of the Indian Evidence Act in respect of\\nexecution and authentication of the Power of Attorney but\\nit has believed the evidence of P.W.2 and Ex.P.18, which\\nin my opinion, is totally incorrect. The matter would have\\nbeen different had the plaintiff examined the concerned\\nofficer who was in-charge of the Division/Office as on\\n3.2.1988. If the evidence of P.W.2 is left out, there\\nremains the interested evidence of the plaintiff alone\\nwhich is not cogent and satisfactory. The Trial Court has80 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nalso erred in coming to the conclusion that the plaintiff is\\nin possession of the property by ignoring Ex.D.5, D.7 and\\nD.8. The Trial Court has lost sight of the fact that there\\nare three sale deeds in the names of the defendants No.2\\nto 8 through which title and possession has been\\nconveyed and they have set up rival titles and when this is\\nso, without seeking the relief of declaration of title and\\nalso possession, the Trial Court erred in decreeing the\\nsuit. The Trial Court without any reasons has disbelieved\\nthe evidence of D.W.3 the holder of Power of Attorney and\\nD.W.4 the Advocate who had identified the plaintiff while\\nexecuting the Power of Attorney but it has come to the\\nconclusion that on 3.2.1988 the plaintiff was working at\\nMamdapur discharging his official duty. This is\\nerroneous. It was argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the\\nsuit property was sold by the first defendant in favour of\\nthe second defendant for a paltry sum though the market\\nvalue was more than Rs.1,81,000 and likewise the second\\ndefendant sold the property in favour of the third\\ndefendant for Rs.90,000/- though the market value was\\nmore than Rs.2,00,000/- and hence, the defendants No.281 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nto 8 are not bonafide purchasers. The argument could\\nhave been appreciated had the plaintiff proved the fraud\\nand forgery committed by the first defendant towards\\nEx.D.1. Even otherwise the Sub-Registrar has collected\\nthe correct market value and thus, the argument is\\nrepelled. Likewise the Trial Court has on its own\\ncompared the signatures of the plaintiff under Section 73\\nof the evidence Act which according to the catena of\\ndecisions is not correct. Thus, considering all the above, in\\nmy opinion, the judgment and decree of the Trial Court\\nrequires interference. Hence, point No.5 is answered in\\nthe affirmative.\\nPOINT No.6:\\n78. In view of discussion made on points No.1 to 5, I\\nproceed to pass the following:\\nO R D E R\\nThe appeals bearing R.A. Nos.18/2010,\\n23/2010, 24/2010 and 30/2010 are allowed.82 RA Nos.18/10,23/10,24/10,30/10\\nThe judgment and decree dated\\n19.12.2009 passed in O.S.

Dharwad Rural sub-\\ndivision, Dharwad, for the offence punishable U/s.324, 354, 504 and 506\\nIPC R/w.sec.34 there of and also for the offence punishable U/s.03[01] of\\nSC/ST [POA] Act 1989 in Cr.No.109/2010 of Annigeri P.S. registered on\\nthe report of C.W.01 – Devappa, the allegation against the accused\\nNos.01 to 3 is that:2 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\nthey in furtherance of common intention to insult, assault and\\nintimidate C.W.07 Sangappa – a member of Hindu-Chalawadi community\\n– a schedule caste, on 06/07/2010 at about 09.30 p.m. in front of the milk\\ndairy in Nagarahalli village of Navalgund Taluk abused him filthily to\\nprovoke or intending or knowing it was likely to provoke him to cause to\\nbreak public peace, and further accused No.01 voluntarily caused him\\nsimple hurt with a club, accused No.03 caused simple hurt to C.W.08\\nManjappa – the son of said C.W.07 when he rushed to the rescue of his\\nfather, and further they also outraged the modesty of C.W.06 Dyamawwa\\n– the daughter of said C.W.07 when she also rushed there to the rescue\\nof her father, by using criminal force and pulling her sari, and further they\\nall threatened the said C.Ws.06, 07 and 08 to life and also humiliated or\\ndefamed the said C.W.08 by abusing in the name of his caste, they not\\nbeing the members of schedule caste or schedule tribe.\\n02. All the accused are on bail. Provision of section 207 Cr.P.C. has\\nbeen complied with by furnishing each of them a copy of charge sheet and\\nits papers.\\n03. All the accused have defended the prosecution by a common\\ncounsel of their choice.\\n04. After hearing on both the side, when the accused were called\\nupon to take charge for the offence punishable U/s.504, 324, 354 and 506\\nIPC and also for the offence punishable U/s.03[01] of SC/ST [POA] Act\\nr/w.sec.34 of IPC, they pleading innocence claimed trial.\\n05. Therefore, in order to substantiate its several allegations under\\ncharge the prosecution has offered the testimony of ten witnesses apart\\nfrom exhibiting 11 documents and 02 material objects.3 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\n06. The defence of the accused at the trial as well as in their\\nexamination U/s.313 Cr.P.C. is one of total denial submitting further that,\\non account of political grudge the case has been foisted.\\n07. The accused have not offered any evidence in defence.\\n08. I have heard the argument.\\n09. The points which arise for my consideration are:\\n01) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt\\nthat accused Nos.01 to 03 in furtherance of common\\nintention, intentionally insulted P.W.05 Sangappa [C.W.07]\\nby abusing filthily, as alleged ?\\n02) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt\\nthat accused Nos.01 to 03 in furtherance of common\\nintention, voluntarily caused simple hurt to the said P.W.05\\nand his son P.W.06 Manjappa [C.W.08] with clubs, as\\nalleged?\\n03) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt\\nthat accused Nos.01 to 03 in furtherance of common\\nintention, outraged the modesty of P.W.04 Dyamawwa\\n[C.W.06] by pulling her sari, as alleged?\\n04) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt\\nthat accused Nos.01 to 03 in furtherance of common\\nintention, criminally intimidated the said P.Ws.04, 05 and 06\\nto life, as alleged ?\\n05) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt\\nthat accused Nos.01 to 03 in furtherance of common\\nintention, humiliated and annoyed the said P.W.04- a\\nmember of schedule caste within public view by referring to\\nhis caste, as alleged ?4 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\n06) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt\\nthat accused Nos.01 to 03 in furtherance of common\\nintention, used criminal force on the said P.W.04 by pulling\\nher sari with intend to dishonor as she belongs to schedule\\ncaste, as alleged ?\\n07) What order ?\\n10. My finding on the above points are as under:\\nPoint No.01: In negative.\\nPoint No.02: In negative.\\nPoint No.03: In negative.\\nPoint No.04: In negative.\\nPoint No.05: In negative.\\nPoint No.06: In negative.\\nPoint No.07: See the final order;\\nREASONS\\nPoint Nos.01 to 06:-\\n11. I have stated above the nature of the several allegations casted at\\nthe accused, under charge. In order to substantiate the same, the\\nprosecution has offered the testimony of ten witnesses. Among them:\\nP.W.01 Devappa is the first informant of the crime to police. His\\nreport is at Ex.P.01. He is not a victim of the crime alleged, instead, is\\nexamined as one of its ocular witness.\\nP.W.04 - Dyamawwa and her father P.W.05- Sangappa and brother\\nP.W.06 - Manjappa are all the victims of the crime under charge.\\nP.W.02 -Suresh and P.W.03 -Parasappa are examined as ocular\\nwitnesses to the scene of crime.\\nP.W.09- Sharanappa Chalawadi and P.W.10- Sharanappa Kale are\\nthe witnesses of the spot mahazar Ex.P.02 where under the prosecution5 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\nclaims to have seized the two clubs [M.O.Nos.01 and 01-a] the weapons\\nof offence.\\nP.W.07 -Dr.V.P.Kallangadi of Navalgund General Hospital has\\ndeposed to his examination of the injured P.W.05 and his son P.W.06, and\\nalso issuing of the respective wound certificates at Exs.P.05 and P.06\\nopining that the injury noticed on the respective persons were all simple in\\nnature. It is also his evidence that they could have been caused by the\\nclubs like the one at M.O.Nos.01 and 01-a.\\nP.W.08- A.B.Basari – Dy.S.P. Dharwad Rural Police sub-division,\\nDharwad has deposed to the investigation and submission of the charge\\nsheet in the crime.\\nC.W.14- M.H.Badari – the then Sub Inspector of Annigeri P.S. who\\nis said to have had registered the crime, has not turned up to give\\nevidence despite receipt of summons.\\n12. The fact that P.Ws.04 to 06 are the members of schedule caste\\nwhereas the accused are not either of schedule caste or schedule tribe, is\\nnot in dispute.\\n13. In order to bring home the guilt under charge the prosecution, apart\\nfrom the evidence of injured – victims P.Ws.04 to 06, has also relied upon\\nthe testimony of P.W.01 – the first informant and also of P.Ws.02 and 03 -\\nthe so called independent ocular witnesses.\\n14. Among P.Ws.01 to 03, it is the evidence of P.W.02 that, on that\\nnight hearing some galata from Anganawadi side when he went there,\\nsaw a large gathering and his maternal uncle P.W.05, and P.Ws.04 and\\n06 the children of P.W.05 were also there apart from P.W.01, but not any\\nof the accused, and that he was told P.W.05 had sustained injury on\\nback and P.W.06 on right leg. He has not corroborated the prosecution6 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\nversion of the case to fasten any of the accused to that act. Though the\\nprosecution has cross examined this witness by treating as hostile, has\\nnot brought out any material in support of any allegations under charge.\\nOn the other hand, he by contradicting his statement Exs.P.03 and P.04\\nbefore the I.O. has maintained his evidence in chief-examination.\\n15. It may also be noted at this stage itself that, P.W.07 doctor who\\nhas deposed that when he attended on P.W.05 and P.W.06 on\\n07/07/2010 at about 11.40 a.m. with history of assault on the previous\\nnight, though noticed on the person of P.W.07 two contusions each one\\non the right side chest and right side back and another abrasion on right\\nknee and so on the person of P.W.06 a swelling with contusion over the\\nfront of forehead and a contusion on the right side lumbar, as stated in\\nthe respective wound certificates at Exs.P.05 and P.06 and they were all\\nsimple in nature, but it is his specific evidence in cross- examination and\\nby referring to the MLC register which he had brought that, either of the\\ninjured had told him that it was the accused who assaulted them. If really,\\nit was so, naturally while furnishing history of injury, P.Ws.05 and 06 would\\nhave stated before P.W.07- doctor that it was the act of the accused, as\\nthey knew them well. Therefore, non-disclosure of name of any of the\\naccused by the injured before P.W.07- doctor, at the earliest point of time,\\nrather gives room to suspect that accused must have had been falsely\\nimplicated in the report Ex.P.01 lodged by P.W.01 about six hours\\nthereafter.\\n16. Be that as it may, let me now appreciate the testimony of the victims\\nP.Ws.04 to 06 and of P.W.01 the first informant.7 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\n17. P.Ws.4 to 06, it is true, have deposed that on that night near\\nSharanabasaveshwar Math accused were assaulting PW.5 and when\\nP.Ws.4 and 6 rushed there to his rescue they were also abused in the\\nname of caste and further outraged the modesty of PW.4 by holding her\\ntuft, and which PW-01 has also corroborated to some extent.\\nI need not say that in a criminal trial, consistency is not the only\\ncriteria, but it should also be credible to act upon.\\n18. It is in evidence that when P.Ws.4 and 6 rushed to the spot, there\\nwas a gathering of about 50 to 60 persons. Further it is the evidence of\\nPW.4 and PW.6 that on account of load shedding of electricity there was\\nno supply of electricity in the village from 7.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. PW.3 has\\nnot admitted this fact, despite the prosecution itself producing the letter\\nEx.P.9 said to have been collected by him from the Section Officer\\n[Rural] HESCOM, Navalgund, in evidence through I.O. That being so, the\\nfact remains that when the alleged incident occurred there was no\\nelectricity in the village and since it was dark hours of the night, the\\nwitnesses could not have identified the persons in the mob who assaulted\\nthem.\\n19. One other aspect of the matter is that, it is the evidence of PW.1in\\nchief-examination itself that within half an hour of informing Annigeri\\npolice about the incident and immediately thereafter, they had rushed to\\nthe spot and sent PW.5 and PW.6 to Navalgund hospital with the\\ninstructions that he should go over the station on the next day to lodge\\nreport and so accordingly, he reported the matter as per Ex.P.1 on the\\nnext day i.e. on 7/7/2010. It is also the evidence of P.Ws-01, 03, 04 and\\n06 that, on the same night the injured were shifted to Navalgund hospital\\nfor treatment. But, PW-05 who has not whispered a word in that regard\\nhas only stated that, from the place they were sent home. Be that as it\\nmay, as per the medical evidence it was on the next day between 11.30\\na.m. and 11.45 a.m. P.Ws-05 and 06 went to hospital. Again, reporting of8 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\nthe matter with police was not on the next morning instead, in the evening\\nby 6 0’ clock i.e. about 20 hours after the alleged incident. In fact, in Ex.P-\\n01, PW-01 has stated that after sending the injured to hospital and\\ndiscussing the matter with the persons of their community, he lodged that\\nreport with the further warning to police that if no steps is taken there on,\\nmatte would be reported to the Supdt. of Police. Thus, it only go to infirm\\nand as rightly canvassed for the defence it was after due deliberation,\\nPW.1 lodged report. If really the police had come to the village on the\\nsame night and were to send the injured to hospital, and with the\\ninstructions to PW.1 that he should lodge report on the next day, definitely\\nthe injured who would not have forgotten to say so. In fact, the evidence of\\nPW.5 in chief- examination itself is that, the villagers who intervened,\\nrescued him from the galata and sent him home. If really the injured could\\nidentify the accused in the gathering, definitely they could have named at\\nleast some of the other persons in the gathering. But it is the specific\\nevidence of PWs.5 and 6 that as there were 50 to 60 persons in the\\ngathering, they cannot say who were all its members and what all they did.\\n20. The evidence of PW-03 – a relative of P.Ws-01, 04 to 06 is that,\\nhaving seen accused No-01 assaulting his father-in-law PW-05 with a\\nclub, he and other villagers pacified the quarelling parties and then had\\nbrought PW-01 to the place to shift the injured PW-05 to hospital. He has\\nnot whispered a word about the assault on PW-06 or abuse or dishonoring\\nthe modesty of PW-04 by the accused lest, to their presence even at the\\nplace. This evidence also rather takes away the veracity of the\\nprosecution case from its very bottom, as projected.\\n21. Before parting with it may also be noted that, P.W.9 one of the\\nattesting witness of Ex.P.2 mahazar where under the prosecution claims\\nto have seized two clubs the weapon of offence, has not corroborated it.9 SC/ST/CC.No.21/2010\\nOf course PW.10 though has corroborated, but what is pertinent to note\\nthat recording of Ex.P.2 was on the third day of the alleged incident i.e. on\\n8/7/2010 and between 8.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. But in the beginning of\\nthe panchanama it is stated that it was on the very next day i.e. on\\n7/7/2010, of the alleged incident. But obviously, the registration of the\\ncrime itself was on 7/7/2010 at about 6.00 p.m. Thus it would only go to\\nshow how unmindfully the I.O. has recorded Ex.P.2. Further, it is rather\\ndifficult to accept also that till the third day of the alleged incident, the two\\nclubs the weapon of offence were still lying at the place – a public road,\\nbeing undisturbed and more particularly when the place was not under\\nsurveillance.\\n22. Therefore and for the foregoing, viewed from any angle, I am of\\nthe considered view that the case as projected by the prosecution cannot\\nbe accepted as true and proved beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, my\\nfinding on all these points is in the negative.\\nPoint No.7:-\\n23.

Present appeal under clause 15 of the Letters\\nPatent is directed against the order dated 3.3.2010\\npassed by the learned Single Judge rejecting the\\npetition preferred by the present appellants against\\nthe order passed by the learned trial Court, at an\\ninterlocutory stage, below Exh.283 in Civil Suit\\nNo.915 of 1989.\\n2. The petitioners before the learned Single Judge\\nare the original defendant Nos.1 to 3 before the trial\\nCourt.\\n3. The facts, which emerge from the record, can be\\nsummarized thus:-\\n3.1 Present opponents i.e. the original plaintiffs\\nhave filed a suit for enforcement of the development\\nagreement executed between the plaintiffs and the\\noriginal defendants i.e. the petitioners-appellants.\\n3.2 During the pendency of the suit, after the\\nevidence of the plaintiffs was concluded, the\\noriginal defendants i.e. present petitioners-\\nappellants filed an application (Exh.283) requesting\\nthe Court to pass an order to appoint a Handwriting\\nExpert and refer the document in question for the\\nopinion of Handwriting Expert. The said document in\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 3 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nquestion was already available on record before the\\nCourt at Exh.203.\\n3.3 The said application Exh.283 filed by the\\ndefendants was opposed by the plaintiffs on diverse\\ngrounds. The plaintiffs contended that the\\napplication Exh.283 amounted to requesting the Court\\nto collect the evidence on behalf of the defendants.\\nThe plaintiffs also contended that the defendant No.1\\nhad not examined himself and the witness of the\\ndefendant No.1 had filed examination-in-chief on\\n15.3.2005 (Exh.262) and until then, any dispute about\\nthe signature of the defendant No.1 was not raised by\\nthe said defendant. The plaintiffs also contended\\nthat the agreement in question (Exh.203) dated\\n31.3.1986 and the suit was filed in 1989 whereas the\\napplication (Exh.283) making the aforesaid request\\ncame to be filed in 2007 i.e. after almost 18 years\\nsince the presentation of the suit and that too\\nwithout the evidence of the defendant No.1 being on\\nrecord. In this background, the plaintiffs contended\\nthat the sole intention of the plaintiffs was to\\ndelay the proceedings.\\n3.4 The learned trial Court heard the contesting\\nparties and by its order (below Exh.283) dated\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 4 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\n15.7.2008 rejected the application Exh.283 filed by\\nthe defendants.\\n3.5 Aggrieved by the said order, passed at an\\ninterlocutory stage by the learned trial Court, the\\ndefendants preferred the writ petition and the\\nlearned Single Judge by order dated 3.3.2010 rejected\\nthe said petition. It is against the said order that\\nthe present appeal is preferred.\\n4. We have heard Mr. Gandhi, learned advocate for\\nthe petitioners-appellants and Mr. Bhatt, learned\\nadvocate for the respondents-original plaintiffs.\\n5. The appellants-petitioner original defendants,\\nhave contended that they have disputed the agreement\\nin question in their reply and that therefore, it is\\nnecessary that evidence of independent witness viz.\\nHandwriting Expert may come on record in connection\\nwith the signature, of the defendant No.1. The\\ndefendants have contended that to support their\\nsubmission, the said independent evidence is\\nnecessary.\\n6. It is not in dispute that the agreement in\\nquestion is dated 31.3.1986. It is also not in dispute\\nthat the subject suit No.915 of 1989 has been filed\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 5 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nby the opponents for specific performance of the said\\nagreement dated 31.3.1986 (Exh.203).\\n6.1 It is also not in dispute that though the suit\\nhas been filed since 1989, the disputed application\\n(Exh.283) came to be submitted by the defendants in\\nJuly-2007 i.e. after almost 18 years.\\n6.2 The petitioner-appellant has not disputed the\\nplaintiff's (present respondent) assertion that the\\noriginal defendant No.1 (whose signature is sought to\\nbe disputed) has not deposed before the Court and has\\nnot disputed his signature by his own evidence.\\n6.3 In this background, as aforesaid, the plaintiffs\\nopposed the application.\\n7. It is pertinent that the defendant No.1 (whose\\nsignature is sought to be now disputed) has not\\ndeposed i.e. has not given his own oral evidence and\\nhas not himself disputed his signature by his own\\nevidence before the Court.\\n7.1 Furthermore, any opinion of expert was not\\nplaced on record and/or any expert was not examined\\nby the defendants i.e. present appellants, before\\ntendering the application (Exh:283).\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 6 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\n7.2 Under the circumstances, there was no base and\\nthere is no base or foundation and justification for\\nmaking an application seeking appointment of\\nHandwriting Expert and referring the document in\\nquestion for his opinion.\\n7.3 The objection of the plaintiffs against the said\\napplication to the effect that the application has\\nbeen filed with an ill-intention to delay and derail\\nthe suit proceedings, appears justified in background\\nof facts of present case.\\n8. Having regard to the rival contentions and after\\nhearing the parties, the learned trial Court in the\\norder impugned before the learned Single Judge has\\nobserved that :-\\n“It is not in dispute that the document contending the\\ndisputed signature is produced at Exh.203. As to what is the\\nevidentiary value of the said document or the signature,\\netc. is a question of appreciation at the time of finally\\nhearing the arguments of the parties.”\\n8.1 The trial Court, after having observed, as\\naforesaid, also recorded that:-\\n“If the party is aware of the facts on record, it is for the\\nparty to decide as to when and how it should meet with the\\nfacts and it is not for the Court to assist the party in\\ngetting the witness examined. It is also a settled legal\\nposition that one who asserts must prove and therefore, once\\nthe plaintiff having produced a particular document claiming\\nthat it is a document showing contract between the plaintiff\\nand the 1st defendant, it is for the 1st defendant now to deal\\nwith the said document by leading appropriate evidence\\nbecause it is the defendant No.1 who is asserting that the\\ndocument does not contain his signature.”\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 7 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\n8.2 It is pertinent to note that the learned trial\\nCourt also noted that the defendant No.1 was the best\\nperson to say as to whether or not the document in\\nquestion contained the signature.\\n9. The opponents i.e. the original plaintiffs have,\\nbefore us, contended that until the said application\\nExh.283 came to be submitted and even thereafter\\nuntil the impugned order came to be passed, the\\ndefendant No.1 had not given his evidence and had not\\ndisputed his signature by his own evidence. The said\\nassertion by the plaintiffs-opponents is not disputed\\nbefore us by the appellants-plaintiffs.\\n9.1 The original plaintiffs also asserted\\nbefore us that even during the evidence of the\\nplaintiffs particularly during the cross-examination\\nsuch dispute was not raised or such suggestion\\nwas not put (during cross examination) to the\\nplaintiffs/plaintiffs’ witness. In the submission of\\nthe plaintiffs’ the conjoint effect of the aforesaid\\nprominent factual aspect was clear i.e. the\\nplaintiffs intended to delay the proceedings. The\\nlearned trial Court has then, while concluding the\\norder, observed thus in the impugned order:-\\n“…The fact as to whether the document in question contains\\nthe signature of defendant is in personal knowledge of the\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 8 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\ndefendant no.1 because the defendant no.1 possesses or might\\nbe possessing its admitted signatures and therefore, it is\\nfor the defendant no.1 to discharge his part of the burden.\\nIt may be clarified that this is not to say that the\\nplaintiff has successfully proved the document in question\\nor the contents thereof, that aspect will have to be dealt\\nwith at the time of arguments keeping in view the necessary\\nlegal provisions and the position of law. At this stage, the\\nCourt is dealing with the question of appointment of the\\nHandwriting Expert at the instance of the Court for the\\nfirst defendant. In the opinion of this Court, such an\\napplication cannot be maintained for the simple reason that\\nit is the choice of the first defendant to decide as to how\\nthe first defendant should proceed in the matter and the\\nCourt is not for appointment of a witness for enabling the\\nparty to lead evidence. ….”\\n9.2 The learned Single Judge has taken note of the\\naforesaid aspects and noted the contentions of the\\npetitioners-appellants that Rule-10(A) of Order XXVI\\nof the Code of Civil Procedure does provide for\\ncommission for scientific investigation. The learned\\nSingle Judge also noted that the contention of the\\npetitioners based on the provision under Section 73\\nof the Indian Evidence Act which provides for\\ncomparison of signature. The learned Single Judge has\\nalso noted the petitioners’ submission based on the\\nobservations in the judgments between Ashokkumar\\nUttamchand Shah v. Patel Mohmad Asmal Chanchand\\n{1998(2) GLH 257} and Gaudiya Mission v. Shobha Bose\\n& Anr. {2008 (1) GLH 488}.\\n9.3 The learned Single Judge has observed that the\\nsaid decisions have no application to the facts of\\nthe case and that the provision under Section 73 of\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 9 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nthe Evidence Act does not make it compulsory for the\\nCourt to follow only one course of action. The\\nlearned Single Judge, after detailed discussion, did\\nnot find merits in the petitioners’ contention and\\nrejected the petition.\\n9.4 Mr. Gandhi, learned advocate for the petitioners-\\nappellants, has reiterated the same submissions\\nbefore us. In our view, the appeal does not merit\\nconsideration and we are not inclined to interfere\\nwith the order passed by the learned Single Judge\\nconfirming and approving the interlocutory order\\npassed by the learned trial Court.\\n9.5 In the first instance, the writ petition does not\\ndeserve to be entertained against an interlocuty\\norder.\\n9.6 Furthermore, when the defendants i.e. the\\npetitioners-appellants submit an application after\\npendency of the suit for about 20 years and raise\\nobjection after the evidence of the plaintiffs is\\nover, then, the prima facie impression which the\\nconduct of the defendants would generate is that the\\ndefendants are interested in delaying the\\nproceedings. Besides this, it does not come out from\\nthe record that the plaintiffs-appellants have,\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 10 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nbefore tendering the said application, tried to place\\non record any independent opinion of Handwriting\\nExpert, which might have been or could have been\\nobtained by them. In absence of such attempt i.e.\\nwithout examining any witness or without placing on\\nrecord opinion of any independent Handwriting Expert\\nwhen the defendants submitted such an application and\\nthe learned trial Court rejected the same with the\\naforesaid observation then, we do not find any error\\nin the said order.\\n9.7 The appellant, instead of tendering the\\napplication (exhibit 283) and prosecuting it over a\\nperiod of some adjournments and inviting order and\\nthen challenging the order in a petition and then\\npreferring Letters Paten Appeal, could have examined\\ntheir own witness. The conduct justifies plaintiff's\\ncontention that the defendant simply intends to delay\\nthe suit.\\n10. The trial Court has, evidentially, examined the\\nrival contentions in detail and has, as noted\\nearlier, observed, and rightly so, that “.... one who\\nasserts must prove and therefore, once the plaintiff\\nhaving produced a particular document claiming that\\nit is a document showing a contract between the\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 11 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nplaintiff and the first defendant, it is for the\\nfirst defendant now to deal with the said document by\\nleading appropriate evidence..” The said observations\\nby the learned trial Court clinches the issue and we\\ndo not find any error in the said observations in\\nlight of which the application preferred by the\\npresent appellants came to be rejected.\\n11. When the application (exhibit-283) is submitted\\nalmost 18 years after presentation of the suit and\\nmuch time after the presentation of the document in\\nquestion on the record and when the defendant\\nNo.1(whose signature is sought to be disputed)\\nhimself has not deposed before the Court and has not\\ndisputed his signature and when during the\\nplaintiff's evidence, particularly in cross-\\nexamination, any question-suggestion to the said\\neffect is not put and when the original defendants\\ni.e. present appellant-petitioners have not examined\\nany witness (even an expert) on the issue of hand-\\nwriting/signature (though they could have done so)\\nand when the learned Trial Court after examining all\\nthe aspects found it appropriate to not to allow the\\napplication (exhibit 283) then, we, in an appeal\\npreferred against an order passed in a petition under\\nArticle 227 of the Constitution of India and that too\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:11:38 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nLPA/1514/2010 12 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nin respect of an interlocutory order, are not only not\\ninclined to interfere but upon examination of the\\norder in light of the facts noted in this order, we\\ndo not find any infirmity in the order by the trial\\nCourt and by the learned Single Judge.\\n12. In our considered view, the order passed by the\\nlearned trial Court does not suffer from any\\ninfirmity. Furthermore, the appeal arising from a\\nwrit petition preferred against interlocutory order\\neven otherwise, does not deserve to be entertained\\nand therefore, we are not inclined to entertain such\\nappeal. More so, when the interlocutory order\\nimpugned in the petition does not deprive the\\ndefendants, in any manner whatsoever of any of their\\nlegal rights and also does not suffer from any error.\\nThe appeal, therefore, fails and deserves to be\\nrejected and the same is rejected.\\nIn view of disposal of main Letters Patent\\nAppeal, Civil Application also stands disposed of.\\n(S.J.

The facts leading to the present application, in nut-\\nshell, are as under:\\n3. That the respondent Nos.1 and 2 submitted the\\napplication for maintenance before the learned Magistrate\\nunder Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the\\nlearned Magistrate awarded the maintenance to respondent\\nNo.1-wife at the rate of Rs.400/- per month and Rs.300/- per\\nmonth to respondent No.2 - girl.\\n4. That the respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed Criminal\\nMisc.

Thus,\\nthe learned Magistrate in all directed the petitioner-husband\\nto pay Rs.1800/- per month to the respondent Nos.1 and 2.\\n5. Mr.Patel , learned advocate appearing on behalf of\\nthe petitioner-husband has submitted that respondent No.2 -\\ngirl has already married on 12th February,2008 and, therefore,\\nrespondent No.2 - girl is not entitled to maintenance at least\\nfrom the date of her marriage.

However, he has submitted that so far as\\nmaintenance awarded to respondent No.1 at the rate of\\nRs.800/- per month, it cannot be said in any way exorbitant in\\nthese hard days. Even with Rs.800/- it is not possible for\\nrespondent No.1 to maintain herself and, therefore, it is\\nrequested not to interfere with the order so far as the orders\\npassed by both the Courts below awarding maintenance of\\nRs.800/- per month to respondent No.1-wife. In fact,\\nrespondent No.1 was aggrieved by the order passed by\\nlearned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Vallabhipur, awarding\\nmaintenance at the rate of Rs.800/- per month and she has\\nalso preferred Criminal Revision Application No.88 of 2005,\\nwhich came to be dismissed by the learned Revisional Court.\\nIt is submitted that due to final constraints, she has not\\nchallenged the order passed by the Revisional Court.\\n7.

The appellant – State has filed this appeal\\nagainst the judgment and order dated 22.12.2010\\nin Special Civil Application No.1 4960 of 2012\\nwhereby the learned single Judge has directed the\\nappellant herein to reconsider the case of the\\nrespondent in it right perspective keeping in\\nview the observations made in order dated\\n15.10.2010 passed in Special Civil Application\\nNo.8553 of 2010.\\n2. The factual details are such that the husband\\nof the original petitioner - respondent herein\\nwas serving as unarmed Police Constable and met\\nwith a fatal accident while riding motorcycle on\\n20.12.2006. The petitioner made an application on\\n8.1.2007 for compassionate appointment.

If we peruse the communication dated\\n30.8.2010, it transpires that the appellants\\nherein has rejected the application for\\ncompassionate appointment of the original\\npetitioner on two simple counts.\\n(1) Original petitioner has not given declaration\\nthat she has remarried;\\n(2) She does not possess educational\\nqualification since she has not cleared the\\nS.S.C. Examination.\\nSuch decision was taken by the D.S.P.,\\nJunagadh in pursuance of directions issued by him\\nvide letter dated 20.2.2010.\\n4. The fact remains that on the date of\\napplication, the original petitioner does not\\nhave the requisite educational qualification.\\nHowever, she got cleared the examination and,\\ntherefore, relying upon the previous decision in\\nSpecial Civil Application No.8553 of 2010 dated\\n15.10.2010, the original petitioner has claimed\\nfor compassionate appointment. The learned Single\\nJudge has considered that the case of the\\noriginal petitioner requires reconsideration at\\nthe hands of the appellant since it squarely\\nfalls within the ambit of such judgment dated\\n15.10.2010.\\nPage 3 of 9\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:32:25 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/LPA/1515/2012 JUDGEMNT\\nundefined\\n5. Heard learned A.G.P. Mr.Rakesh R.Patel for\\nthe appellants and learned advocate Mr.Yatin Soni\\nfor the respondent.\\n6. Learned advocate Mr.Yatin Soni has submitted\\nthat the order of the Single Judge is proper and\\ncorrect inasmuch it does not direct the\\nrespondents to confirm compassionate appointment\\nto the petitioner, but to re-consider the case of\\nthe petitioner, since there is an error in\\nconsidering the factual details of the petitioner\\nand, therefore, there is no illegality and\\nirregularity and, hence, such order cannot be\\ndisturbed and thereby Appeal deserves to be\\ndismissed.\\n7. Learned A.G.P. Mr.Patel has relied upon the\\nseveral decisions of the Hon’ble Apex Court,\\nwhich confirms that compassionate appointment is\\nnot a right of the successor of a deceased\\nemployee and, therefore, it cannot be awarded, as\\nclaimed for, more particularly, now when there is\\nno such scheme in existence.\\n8. Learned A.G.P. Mr.Patel has relied upon\\nfollowing decisions;\\n(1) 2012(5) SCALE 740 : (AIR 2012 SC 2294) -\\nUnion of India v. Shashank Goswami;\\n(2) (2012)7 SCC 248 – Shreejit L. Vs.Deputy\\nDirector (Education), Kerala and\\nPage 4 of 9\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:32:25 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/LPA/1515/2012 JUDGEMNT\\nundefined\\n(3) (2007)9 SCC 571 – State Bank of India &\\nOrs. Vs.Jaspal Kaur.\\nWe do not propose to burden this judgment\\nwith reference to a long line of decisions of\\nthis Court on the point. However, in order to\\nrecapitulate the factors to be taken into\\nconsideration while examining the claim for\\nappointment on compassionate ground, we may\\nrefer to a few decisions touching the point.\\n9. If we peruse the case of Shashank Goswami\\n(supra), though the head-note and outcome suggest\\nthat they cannot be given appointment on\\ncompassionate basis when retiral/terminal\\nbenefits have been received by the family of the\\ndeceased employee, the fact remains that even in\\nlatest judgments, the Apex Court has relied upon,\\nits several previous decisions including decision\\nin Punjab National Bank and Ors. v. Ashwini Kumar\\nTaneja, (2004) 7 SCC 265 : (AIR 2004 SC 4155)\\nwherein also the reliance was placed on an\\nearlier judgment in General Manager (D and PB)\\nand Ors. v. Kunti Tiwari and Anr., (2004) 7 SCC\\n271, and held that compassionate appointment has\\nto be made in accordance with the Rules,\\nRegulations or administrative instructions taking\\ninto consideration the financial condition of the\\nfamily of the deceased.\\nPage 5 of 9\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:32:25 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/LPA/1515/2012 JUDGEMNT\\nundefined\\n10. In an appropriate case, all such judgments\\nmay be scrutinized. Court has to take decision\\nregarding entitlement of the employee for\\ncompassionate appointment because some of the\\njudgments of the Supreme Court were either\\ndistinguished or overruled in some other\\njudgments and, therefore, relying upon one or two\\nparticular judgments, fresh decision regarding\\nentitlement of benefit of compassionate\\nappointment cannot be taken, more particularly,\\nin an appellate jurisdiction, for example\\njudgment in case of Govind Prakash Verma v. Life\\nInsurance Corporation of India and Ors. reported\\nin (2005) 10 SCC 289 had been decided without\\nconsidering earlier judgment, as observed by the\\nApex Court in Mumtaz Yunus Mulani (Smt.) v. State\\nof Maharashtra and Ors., (2008) 11 SCC 384 : (AIR\\n2008 SC (Supp) 305). It is observed in Steel\\nAuthority of India Limited v. Madhusudan Das and\\nOrs. in the case (2008) 15 SCC 560 (AIR 2009 SC\\n1153) that the Apex Court has in large number of\\ndecisions held that the appellant on\\ncompassionate ground cannot claimed as a matter\\nof right, but it must provided for in the rules\\nand, therefore, it would be appropriate to\\nexamine the rules pertaining to particular\\nappointment in a given department.\\nPage 6 of 9\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:32:25 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/LPA/1515/2012 JUDGEMNT\\nundefined\\n11. Therefore, it would be appropriate to follow\\nthe factors to be borne in mind while considering\\nclaim for employment on compassionate ground as\\nlaid down in the case of V.Sivamurthy v. State of\\nAndhra Pradesh and Ors. reported in (2008)8 SCC\\n475 (2008 AIR SCW 5833), which are as under:\\n(i) Compassionate employment cannot be made\\nin the absence of rules or regulations\\nissued by the Government or a public\\nauthority. The request is to be considered\\nstrictly in accordance with the governing\\nscheme, and no discretion as such is left\\nwith any authority to make compassionate\\nappointment dehors the scheme.\\n(ii) An application for compassionate\\nemployment must be preferred without undue\\ndelay and has to be considered within a\\nreasonable period of time.\\n(iii) An appointment on compassionate\\nground is to meet the sudden crisis\\noccurring in the family on account of the\\ndeath or medical invalidation of the bread\\nwinner while in service. Therefore,\\ncompassionate employment cannot be granted\\nas a matter of course by way of largesse\\nirrespective of the financial condition of\\nthe deceased/incapacitated employee's family\\nat the time of his death or incapacity, as\\nthe case may be.\\n(iv) Compassionate employment is permissible\\nonly to one of the dependants of the\\ndeceased/incapacitated employee, viz.\\nPage 7 of 9\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:32:25 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/LPA/1515/2012 JUDGEMNT\\nundefined\\nparents, spouse, son or daughter and not to\\nall relatives, and such appointments should\\nbe only to the lowest category that is Class\\nIII and IV posts.\\n11. In view of above discussions, when the\\nlearned single Judge has directed the department\\nto consider the application for compassionate\\nappointment afresh, we do not find any\\nirregularity in the impugned judgment. It is\\ncertain that the learned single Judge has\\ndirected the present appellant to decide the\\nrepresentation of the respondent i.e. present\\nrespondent for compassionate appointment without\\nentering into merits of the case. This is an\\ninnocuous order and we are not inclined to\\ninterfere with the same in this appeal.\\n12. This Letters Patent Appeal, therefore, fails\\nand is accordingly dismissed.\\n13. Accordingly, the Civil Application also\\nstands disposed of.\\n(V.M.SAHAI, J.)\\n(S.G.SHAH, J.)\\n(binoy)\\nPage 8 of 9\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:32:25 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/LPA/1515/2012 JUDGEMNT\\nundefined\\nPage 9 of 9\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:32:25 IST 2024\",\n",

It is the case of the petitioner that he\\nwas appointed as Extra Departmental Branch Post\\nMaster [hereinafter referred to as ‘EDBPM’] at\\nvillage Gorevali in Kutch in the year 1979 and\\nwas performing his duties satisfactorily. That he\\nwas served with a memo of charges alleging that\\nhe had produced false certificate about his\\neducational qualification and date of birth and\\nthereby violated the provisions of the rules for\\nappointment of EDBPM. That the petitioner has\\ndefended such charges mainly on the ground that\\nhe has not submitted any false certificate and\\ndemanded the copies of several documents from the\\nDepartment. However, it is his case that ignoring\\nhis defence, the Disciplinary Authority has\\ndecided to impose punishment of removal from\\nservice by order dated 4/2/1999.

Heard learned advocate Mr. P H Pathak\\nfor the petitioner. It is submitted by him that\\nat the relevant time, in the year 1979, since\\nnobody was available for appointment as EDBPM in\\nthe village Gorevali, the petitioner was\\ncompelled to join the service as EDBPM and that\\nPage 4 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nhe had served the Department faithfully and\\nwithout any complaint or dispute till the year\\n1999 when he was removed from the services by\\norders which are under challenge. So far as\\nlegality of the decision of the respondents is\\nconcerned, it is submitted by Mr. Pathak that the\\ninitiation of the inquiry after 1989 itself is\\nillegal and unjust, that when respondents have\\nfailed to provide requisite documents to the\\npetitioner; which were specifically asked for by\\nthe petitioner; it cannot be considered by the\\nDisciplinary Authority, Departmental Appellate\\nAuthority as well as CAT that the petitioner has\\nproduced false documents at the time of\\nappointment and, therefore, order of removal is\\nillegal and unjust.\\n5.1. It is further submitted that the\\nDepartment has failed to prove the existence of\\nfalse documents and submission of false document\\nby the petitioner at the time of initial\\nappointment and, therefore, the inquiry itself is\\nillegal and on the same count, the decision of\\nremoval from service is illegal.\\n6. As against that, learned advocate Mr. S\\nA Qureshi for the respondents has submitted that\\nthe Department has started an exercise to make\\nthe departmental information in order and to\\nPage 5 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nregularize the EDBPM in the year 1988 and hence\\nthe information was called for from all the\\nEDBPMs. In continuation of such process, it has\\nbeen noticed by the Department that the\\npetitioner has disclosed false information and,\\ntherefore, if he has submitted some documents at\\nthe relevant time, the same are required to be\\nscrutinized and, therefore, the Department has\\ninitiated an inquiry from the school authorities,\\nwhereby it has been noticed that so far as the\\npresent petitioner is concerned, the information\\ndisclosed by him at the time of his initial\\nappointment in the year 1979 with reference to\\nhis date of birth and educational qualification\\nare not correct in as much as the real date of\\nbirth of the petitioner as per the record of the\\nschool is 12/3/1950. The date of birth disclosed\\nto the Department by the petitioner is 2/8/1953.\\nSimilarly though as per school record, the\\npetitioner had not studied beyond 4th standard,\\nthe information disclosed to the Department by\\nhim at the time of appointment is such that he\\nhas studied upto 7th standard. Therefore, it is\\nsubmitted that since such information is vital\\ninformation for appointment of EDBPM and since\\nsuch information is false, considering it as a\\nviolation of service rules, departmental inquiry\\nwas initiated, proper opportunity was given to\\nthe petitioner to explain and to prove the fact,\\nPage 6 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nbut since the petitioner has failed to prove his\\ninnocence and since the petitioner infringed the\\nprovisions of rule 17 of the EDA [Conduct and\\nService] Rules, 1964, it was decided by the\\nCompetent Authorities to remove him from the\\nservice, which order was confirmed throughout the\\nproceedings and hence prayed to dismiss the\\npetition.\\n7. Before we discuss the rival\\ncontentions of both the sides and scrutinize the\\npleadings and evidence on record, it transpires\\nthat though the affidavit-in-reply is filed on\\nrecord in the year 2005, annexed with almost all\\nrelevant documents, petitioner, who is\\nchallenging his termination order, has not\\nbothered to negativate any such document or any\\nother information in the form of pleadings and\\ndocuments on record, which otherwise bears his\\nown signature and information pertaining to his\\nservices with the respondents. Therefore, so far\\nas such pleadings and documentary evidence are\\nconcerned, there is no other option but to\\nconsider the same, which is otherwise permitted\\nin law by taking adverse inference in absence of\\nany other evidence on record. Such observation is\\nrequired for the simple reason that though on one\\nhand the petitioner himself has stated in his\\npetition that he was appointed as EDBPM as per\\nPage 7 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nrules, he also pleaded that nobody was available\\nfor appointment to handle the post office in the\\nyear 1979 and, therefore, he was appointed as\\nsuch and such story was also admitted by the\\nrespondents in their reply. Therefore, in absence\\nof any contrary evidence on record, there is no\\nreason to disbelieve the documentary evidence,\\nwhich is on record right from departmental\\ninquiry and on record of this petition since 2005\\nand which are never denied by the petitioner\\nexcept in oral argument at the time of final\\nhearing.\\n8. On merits, if we scrutinize the facts\\nand evidence on record, it transpires that though\\nthe petitioner was in service since the year 1979\\nas EDBPM, the Department has in the year 1988\\ncalled for basic information of all EDBPMs by\\ntheir letter No. PF/BPM/88 dated 14/4/1988\\n[Annexure-B to affidavit-in-reply]. In response\\nto such inquiry, the petitioner has filled up and\\nsubmitted a form on 20/1/1989 with his signature\\ndisclosing details as asked for by the\\nDepartment, wherein he has disclosed his date of\\nbirth as 2/8/1953 and educational qualification\\nas standard 7 pass. An attempt was made by Mr.\\nPathak to state that such information was not\\ndisclosed by the petitioner. However, it cannot\\nbe accepted for the simple reason that in the\\nPage 8 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nsaid form at page 75, the person has to disclose\\nthe name of the languages which he can read,\\nwrite or speak and against such column no. 5,\\nlanguages, namely Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu and\\nSindhi are disclosed as known by the petitioner,\\nas the languages which the petitioner can read,\\nwrite and speak. Thus, it cannot be said that all\\nsuch detailed information was not disclosed by\\nthe petitioner in response to the inquiry made by\\nthe Department. It has come on record that since\\nthe Department has found that some information\\nmay not be correct, they have initiated an\\ninquiry and deputed one Mr. J M Antani, M. O. No.\\n1 of East Division of the respondents to verify\\nthe contents of the details submitted by the\\nEDBPMs and said Mr. Antani has submitted his\\ninspection report on 19/8/1993 after visiting the\\nschool of Gorevali, that as per xerox copy of\\nleaving certificate submitted by the petitioner,\\nthe date of birth shown was 2/8/1953; whereas as\\nper school record, it is 12/5/1950 and that in\\nsuch school leaving certificate, though it is\\nstated that the petitioner has studied upto\\nstandard 4, in the xerox certificate submitted by\\nthe petitioner, it is stated that the petitioner\\nhas studied upto standard 7. Even as per school\\nrecord, it is clear that the petitioner has\\nstudied only upto standard 4. Relying on such\\ndiscrepancy and statement of the petitioner\\nPage 9 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nhimself recorded on 16/10/1993; which is produced\\nat Annexure-C with affidavit-in-reply; before Sub\\nDivisional Inspector, Bhuj East, wherein the\\npetitioner has categorically stated that “my\\nschool leaving certificate which is produced in\\nyour office in which my educational qualification\\nshown as standard 7 and the date of birth shown\\nas 02/08/1953, actually I had passed standard 4\\nand my correct date of birth is 12/05/1950. The\\nabove mentioned certificate was wrongly issued by\\nthe school. So, I am once again stating that I am\\nonly standard 4 pass and my date of birth is\\n12/05/1950 and as supporting evidence, I am\\ngiving duplicate copy of my school leaving\\ncertificate.” Such statement was recorded by\\nthe Sub Divisional Inspector in presence of\\nwitness, namely Isha M Mutva and signed by both,\\nthe petitioner and the witness; therefore,\\nsubmission made by Mr. Pathak that such statement\\nwas taken with pressure or coercion cannot be\\naccepted, more particularly in absence of any\\nsuch pleadings on oath on record for last more\\nthan seven years, on behalf of the petitioner.\\n9. It seems that relying upon such inquiry\\nand statement, charge-sheet was issued on\\n18/9/1995 for taking action against the\\npetitioner under Rule 8 of EDA [Conduct and\\nService] Rules, 1964 and statement of amputation\\nPage 10 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nof misconduct was enclosed with such charge,\\nstating that the petitioner has furnished false\\ninformation in connection with his date of birth\\nand educational qualification and, therefore, it\\nis believed that he has prepared and submitted\\nfalse school leaving certificate and tried to\\nsecure appointment on the post of EDBPM\\nirregularly though he was not eligible and,\\ntherefore, he has failed to maintain absolute\\nintegrity and devotion to duty and thereby\\nviolated the provisions of Rule 17 of EDA\\n[Conduct and Service] Rules, 1964.\\n10. The contention of the petitioner that\\nthe departmental inquiry and punishment is\\nillegal because he was not supplied with the\\nrelevant documents is also negatived since the\\nDepartment has vide their letter No.\\nB3/Disc./Gorewali/95 dated 30/10/1995 forwarded\\ncopies of 10 documents to the petitioner by Regd.\\nPost A.D., and acknowledgment of such Regd. Post\\nis also produced on record at Annexure-A and A-1\\nrespectively. So far as non-supply of some of the\\ndocuments is concerned, the letter dated\\n13/12/1988 at Annexure-B1 confirms that some of\\nthe documents like joining charge report and\\norder as well as appointment order were not\\navailable on record and, therefore, the same were\\nnot provided to the petitioner. The fact remains\\nPage 11 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nthat because of non-availability of particular\\nrecord and information, the Department has\\ninitiated an inquiry and called upon all such\\ninformation not only from the present petitioner,\\nbut all the EDBPMs and in response to such\\ninquiry, when the petitioner has submitted a duly\\nfilled in form on 20/1/1989 and thereafter, when\\nthe Department has found that the information\\nsubmitted by the petitioner is not correct and\\nwhen the petitioner himself has admitted such\\nfacts in his statement dated 16/10/1993, now the\\npetitioner cannot blame the Department by stating\\nthat the Department has not provided him\\nrequisite information and he was not at fault in\\ndisclosing such improper information and thereby\\nthe petitioner cannot claim reliefs as prayed for\\nthroughout the proceedings.\\n11. The fact remains that the information\\nwhich is found to be improper, namely date of\\nbirth and educational qualification, is very well\\nwithin the personal knowledge of the petitioner\\nhimself since it is his own date of birth and it\\nis his own educational qualification and,\\ntherefore, there is no reason for the Department\\nto disclose something different than the\\ninformation which is submitted by the petitioner\\nto the Department. Therefore, the statement dated\\n16/10/1993 of the petitioner before the Sub\\nPage 12 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nDivisional Inspector, Bhuj East that actually he\\nhas passed standard 4 and his correct date of\\nbirth is 12/5/1950 is to be believed without any\\nhesitation and once there is admission by the\\npetitioner himself about the correctness of the\\ndocuments already produced by him, now he cannot\\nclaim benefit of his own wrong.\\n12. The petitioner has relied upon the\\nfollowing decisions :\\n[i] AIR 1998 SC 1833 between State of Andhra\\nPradesh and N. Radhakishan,\\n[ii]2002 LAB. I.C. 1198 between K.B. Trivedi\\nand State of Gujarat,\\n[iii] AIR 2012 SC 3285 between Bharatiya Seva\\nSamaj Trust and Yogeshbhai Ambalal\\nPatel.\\n13. So far as the decision in the case of\\nK.B. Trivedi’s case [supra] is concerned, it is\\nsolely based and relied upon the decision\\nrendered in the case of N. Radhakishan [supra]\\nand, therefore, they can be dealt with together.\\nBefore discussing said judgments, it would be at\\nadvantage to refer to the latest judgment of the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court of India rendered in the\\ncase of Secretary, Ministry of Defence v/s.\\nPrabhash Chandra Mirdha reported in AIR 2012 SC\\n2250. In such latest judgment, the Hon’ble\\nPage 13 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nSupreme Court has considered several decisions\\nrelating to disciplinary proceedings and crux of\\nseveral judgments including judgment of N.\\nRadhakishan [supra] is narrated in para. 9 as\\nunder :\\n“9. Law does not permit quashing of\\nchargesheet in a routine manner. In case the\\ndelinquent employee has any grievance in\\nrespect of the chargesheet he must raise the\\nissue by filing a representation and wait for\\nthe decision of the disciplinary authority\\nthereon. In case the chargesheet is challenged\\nbefore a court/tribunal on the ground of delay\\nin initiation of disciplinary proceedings or\\ndelay in concluding the proceedings, the\\ncourt/tribunal may quash the chargesheet after\\nconsidering the gravity of the charge and all\\nrelevant factors involved in the case weighing\\nall the facts both for and against the\\ndelinquent employee and must reach the\\nconclusion which is just and proper in the\\ncircumstance.”\\nTherefore, the contention of the petitioner\\ncannot sustain that merely because there is delay\\nin issuing charge-sheet, departmental inquiry\\ncannot be continued. However, if we scrutinize\\nboth cited decisions, the fact becomes clear that\\nin said cited cases, the delay was attributed to\\nsome improper or irregular activities by the\\nPage 14 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\ndelinquents during their regular duty as such.\\nWhereas in the present case, practically there is\\nno delay in as much as when the Department has\\nstarted to make their record in order and called\\nfor certain information from the delinquent and\\nwhen such information was found improper, it was\\nconfirmed to the Department only after 1993 that\\nthe petitioner has submitted false documents and,\\ntherefore, charge-sheet issued in the year 1995\\ncould not be said to be delayed, as observed in\\nthe cited cases. Moreover, the latest judgment of\\nthe Hon’ble Supreme Court has specifically\\nclarified that law does not permit quashing of\\nthe charge-sheet in a routine manner. It has been\\nclarified by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that for\\nquashing the charge-sheet, only delay is not to\\nbe taken into consideration, but gravity of\\ncharge and all relevant factors involved in the\\ncase weighing all facts both, for and against\\nthe delinquent – employee, shall be taken into\\nconsideration. Therefore, cited cases are not\\nhelpful to the petitioner to get the reliefs, as\\nclaimed.\\n14. So far as judgment rendered in the\\ncase of Yogesh Ambalal Patel’s case [supra] is\\nconcerned, learned advocate Mr. Pathak has\\nreferred Head Note B and argued that the\\nDepartment cannot take benefit of their own wrong\\nPage 15 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nwhen they have appointed any person relying upon\\nthe information submitted to them, practically\\ngoes against the petitioner himself in as much as\\nthe fact before us are such that if we believe\\nthe story as it is, then in fact the Department\\nhas relied upon the improper information\\nsubmitted by the petitioner that his date of\\nbirth is 2/8/1953 and that he has passed 7th\\nstandard, while appointing him on the post of\\nEDBPM; whereas on scrutiny, it has been found\\nthat his date of birth is 12/5/1950 and he has\\nnot cleared standard 7th, but he has studied only\\nupto standard 4. Therefore, practically, this\\ncitation also goes against the petitioner himself\\nthat one cannot take benefit of his own wrong.\\nMoreover, the petitioner has never alleged and\\nthereby never proved that there is any malice or\\ndiscrimination or victimization of the\\npetitioner, which were the grounds for which\\nHon’ble Supreme Court has decided accordingly in\\nsuch cited judgments and, therefore, such\\njudgments are not helpful to the petitioner in\\nany manner.\\n15. The judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court\\nrendered in the case of Daya Shankar Yadav v/s.\\nUnion of India reported in [2010] 14 S.C.C. 103\\nconfirms that when somebody has clearly\\nsuppressed the material fact and thereby made a\\nPage 16 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nfalse statement, even assuming that there was\\nambiguity in the record, but when such\\ninformation was required to be furnished by the\\ndeclarant, it is to be believed that the\\ndeclarant has knowingly made a false statement\\nand, therefore, order of termination of service\\nof the employee delinquent was confirmed, by\\nthe Hon’ble Supreme Court. Though factual details\\nmay be different in such reported case and in the\\npresent case, the sum and substance of the cited\\ncases is clear that if somebody had knowingly\\nmade a false statement about his own details,\\nthen his termination under the relevant rules\\ncannot be quashed.\\n16. It is rightly observed by the CAT that\\nthis is not the case of improper appointment,\\nwhich has been terminated, but it is a case of\\ndepartmental action having been initiated for\\nfurnishing false information and producing false\\ndocuments.\\n17. Even otherwise the CAT has considered\\nall the relevant aspects and all relevant\\ndocuments available on record in proper manner\\nand we do not find any irregularity or illegality\\nin the judgment and order of the CAT, which is\\nimpugned herein for quashing the termination of\\nPage 17 of 18\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:36:42 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nC/SCA/13908/2005 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nthe petitioner which had taken place in the year\\n1999. Thereby there is no reason for this Court\\nto interfere with the findings, which are against\\nthe petitioner throughout the proceedings, in the\\nproceedings under Article 226 or 227 of the\\nConstitution of India since there is no\\nirregularity or illegality and the impugned order\\nis just and proper. Nothing further was submitted\\nby the petitioner.\\n18. In view of the above facts and\\ncircumstances of the case and discussion, there\\nis no merits in the arguments and petition by the\\npetitioner to quash his order of termination and\\nimpugned order of CAT, which results into nothing\\nbut dismissal of this petition.\\n19. In the result, the petition is\\ndismissed. Rule is discharged. However\\nconsidering the status of the litigant, there is\\nno order as to costs.\\n( V.M. SAHAI, J.)\\n( S.G.

In view of the said declaration by the claimants, the\\nlearned Tribunal also, by passing the award impugned in the\\nappeal, treated the application under Section-163-A as final\\nclaim petition and has made the award accordingly.\\nAt the time of hearing of the appeal, learned advocate\\nDownloaded on : Thu Apr 11 23:08:12 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nFA/183/2003 3/5 ORDER\\nundefined\\nMr. Shah appearing for the opponent nos.1 to 3 raised\\nobjection that the procedure required to be complied with\\nunder Section-170 was not complied with by the appellant\\ninsurance company when the proceedings were pending\\nbefore the learned Tribunal and that therefore, the appeal\\nunder Section-173 is not maintainable. So as to ascertain the\\nfactual aspect, learned advocate Mr. Mehta for the appellant\\ncompany had sought time and hearing of the appeal was\\nadjourned.\\nToday learned advocate Mr. Mehta has fairly admitted\\nthat at the material point of time the insurance company had\\nnot complied with the requirements under Section-170 and\\nany application seeking permission to defend the claim\\npetition, as required under provisions of Section-170, was not\\nfiled by the applicant company and necessary permission was\\nnot obtained.

The brief facts of the petitioner are as\\nunder;\\n3.1 The petitioner being a Chartered\\nAccountant was appointed as Professional Non-\\nExecutive Director of Nisu Fincap Ltd., which\\nwas formerly known as Medha Finance &\\nSecurities Ltd. on 6.7.1995. The company had\\nissued prospectus for public issue on\\nPage 2 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\n5.1.1996.\\n3.2 The petitioner had resigned as\\nDirector from the company on 1.4.1997. It is\\nthe case of the petitioner that he has never\\nparticipated as a Director of the company and\\nnever attended any board meeting or general\\nmeeting of the company and did not receive any\\nsitting fee or any kind of remuneration either\\ndirectly or indirectly in any kind from the\\ncompany during his tenure as a Director of the\\ncompany, which came to an end on 1.4.1997.\\nHowever, he received a show-cause notice dated\\n29.3.2002 from the respondent No.2 regarding\\nviolation of Sections 63, 68 and 628 of the\\nCompanies Act, 1956 by the company, which was\\nreplied in detail by him on 3.6.2002. Inspite\\nof specific reply in detail by the petitioner\\nthat as he has already resigned as Director of\\nthe company since 1.4.1997, he cannot be held\\nliable for the offences, if any, committed by\\nthe company; respondent No.2 has preferred a\\nCriminal Case No.136 of 2002 in the Court of\\nAddl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad\\nagainst the petitioner as well as other\\nDirectors of the company for the offences\\npunishable u/ss.63, 68 and 628 of the\\nCompanies Act.\\n3.3 It is further stated that even after\\none complaint is filed under the Companies\\nPage 3 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nAct, the respondent No.2 has preferred another\\ncomplaint by way of FIR before the Navrangpura\\nPolice Station u/ss.403, 406, 415, 418, 420\\nand 424 of the IPC, which is registered as\\nC.R.No.I – 861 of 2003, which is under\\nchallenge in the present petition.\\n4. Heard learned advocate Mrs.Sangeeta N.Pahwa\\nfor the petitioner, learned A.P.P. Ms.Jirga\\nJhaveri for respondent No.1 and learned\\nadvocate Mr.N.D.Gohil for respondent No.2.\\n5. On above factual aspect, petitioner has prayed\\nto quash such second FIR being C.R.No.I – 861\\nof 2003 pending before the Navrangpura Police\\nStation on the ground that there cannot be two\\ncomplaints for the same offences and that in\\nfact, the petitioner has already resigned on\\n1.4.1997 and, therefore, complaint against the\\npetitioner cannot sustain. It is also stated\\nthat there are no allegations, which can\\nattract or prove even prima-facie, the\\ncommission of any offence qua the petitioner\\nand, therefore, such FIR amounts to abuse of\\nprocess of law and needs to be quashed.\\n6. On perusal of record, it is clear that the FIR\\nin question being C.R.No. I – 861 of 2003 is\\nfiled on 28.8.2003 whereas before such FIR, a\\ncriminal case being No.136 of 2002 was filed\\nby respondent No.2 before the Metropolitan\\nPage 4 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nMagistrate Court, Ahmedabad for the same\\nirregularities regarding non-submission of\\naccounts of Nisu Fincap Ltd. If we peruse both\\nsuch complaints, it clearly emerged that\\nM/s.Nisu Fincap Ltd. was incorporated on\\n21.10.1994 and it came out with a public issue\\nof equity shares vide their prospectus date\\n5.1.1996 whereas show-cause notice was issued\\non 29.5.2002. However, in the criminal case\\nNo.136 of 2002, there is no specific statement\\nthat company has committed breach for which\\nyear so far as offences u/ss.63, 68 and 628\\nof the Companies Act are concerned. Even the\\nshow-cause notice dated 29.5.2002 does not\\ndisclose the year for which there is a breach,\\nif at all it is committed by the company or\\nits Director. However, it is first time\\ndisclosed in the complaint before the\\nNavrangpura Police Station on 28.8.2003 that\\ncompany has not filed accounts from the year\\n1999 – 2000. Therefore, it is submitted by\\nMrs.Pahwa, learned advocate for the petitioner\\nthat the allegation regarding commission of\\noffences u/ss.63, 68 and 628 of the Companies\\nAct is not certain and when allegations under\\nthe IPC are specifically for the year 1999 –\\n2000 and thereafter, considering the fact that\\npetitioner has already resigned as Director of\\nthe company from 1.4.1997, he cannot be held\\nliable or responsible neither for any activity\\nPage 5 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nof the company nor for the commission of\\noffence, if at all any committed by such\\ncompany from the year 1999 and thereafter.\\n7. As against that it is submitted by\\nMr.N.D.Gohil, learned advocate for the\\nrespondent No.2 that since prospectus were\\npublished in 1996 and that public issue was\\nfloated after such prospectus and company has\\ncollected huge amount based upon such\\nprospectus before the resignation of the\\npresent petitioner, he cannot escape from his\\nresponsibility and liability and, therefore,\\nthere is no substance in the petition and\\nrequested to dismiss the same. Except said\\nground that prospectus was issued in the year\\n1996 and public issue was also floated\\nimmediately thereafter, there is nothing on\\nrecord and learned advocate Mr.N.D.Gohil could\\nnot show any activity or misdeed, if at all\\ncommitted by the present petitioner in any\\nmanner.\\n8. On perusal of the record and considering the\\nsubmissions of both the sides, it is crystal\\nclear that the prospectus were issued in the\\nyear 1996 followed by public issue. The\\npresent petitioner has resigned as Director of\\nthe company on 1.4.1997, which fact is placed\\non record in the form of certified copy of\\nForm No.32, which is supported by affidavit of\\nPage 6 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nthe petitioner and when such form was\\ncertified by Assistant Registrar of Companies\\ni.e. Officer of respondent No.2 and when\\nrespondents have not come forward either to\\nplead or prove that the factum of resignation\\nand date of resignation is not correct and\\nthat the petitioner was Director of the\\ncompany at the relevant time, there is not\\nreason to disbelieve such fact that though the\\npetitioner was initially the Director of the\\ncompany, he was not concerned with such\\ncompany from 1.4.1997, when his resignation\\nwas recorded by respondent No.2.\\n9. Then the crucial issue remains for\\nconsideration is regarding the irregularities,\\noffences or anything that have been committed\\nby the company or by the present petitioner.\\nIt is clear from the record that the\\ncomplainant has not stated either in the show-\\ncause notice or in the complaint under the\\nCompanies Act before the Metropolitan\\nMagistrate Court, Ahmedabad or even in the\\ncomplaint before the Navrangpura Police\\nStation for the alleged offences under IPC\\nthat company has not forwarded the accounts\\nright from the year 1996 till the date of\\ncomplaint; on the contrary, though there is\\nvague statement in the show-cause notice and\\nin the complaint under the Companies Act\\nbefore the Metropolitan Magistrate Court,\\nPage 7 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nAhmedabad, there is clear disclosure in the\\ncomplaint before the Navrangpura Police\\nStation, which is assailed in the present\\npetition, that the company has not forwarded\\nthe accounts from the year 1999 – 2000 and it\\nis continued till filing of such complaint. If\\nit is so, then, it is clear that respondent\\nNo.2 – Authority has received the accounts\\nfrom the year 1996 till the year 1999 and when\\nthe petitioner has resigned from the company\\nin the year 1997, then he cannot be held\\nresponsible and liable either for the offences\\nor for the irregularities if at all it was\\ncommitted by the company or its remaining\\nDirectors from the year 1999 onwards. It is\\nalso clear from the record that while filing\\nthe complaint in the year 2002 before the\\nMetropolitan Magistrate Court being Criminal\\nCase No.136 of 2002 for the alleged offences\\nunder the Companies Act, the respondent No.2 –\\nAuthority has clearly disclosed the name and\\naddresses of the Directors of the company and,\\ntherefore, it is surprising to note that while\\nfiling a complaint before the Navrangpura\\nPolice Station, within less than a year i.e.\\non 28.8.2003, it is vaguely stated against the\\ncolumn of accused that Promoters/Directors,\\nwho had signed prospectus of Nisu Fincap Ltd.\\nIt is also to be noted that when respondent\\nNo.2 – Authority possesses all the record with\\nPage 8 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nit regarding all the Promoters/Directors and\\nall other details of the company in their\\noffice, the reason for not disclosing the name\\nof persons as accused before the police\\nauthority gives an impression that respondent\\nwants to give freedom to the police to call\\nupon any person as the Director or Promoter of\\nthe company and to harass them irrespective of\\nthe factual details readily available with\\nthem, more particularly, resignation of the\\npresent petitioner, which was there on record\\nfor long period, say more than five years.\\n10. Considering the above facts and circumstances\\nof the matter, there is substance in the\\narguments of Mrs.Pahwa that, there cannot two\\nprosecution for the same allegations and that\\nimpugned FIR is second complaint for the\\nsimilar allegations for which private\\ncomplaint is already filed and pending at the\\ntime of filing of said petition; ingredients\\nof commission of offence alleged in the\\nimpugned FIR could not attract the liability\\nof the present petitioner since he has already\\nresigned in the year 1997; the respondent No.2\\n– complainant has willfully hide and failed to\\ndisclose the fact of reply of show-cause\\nnotice to them; the impugned FIR is lodged\\nafter the period of six years and, therefore,\\nthe petition deserves to be allowed by\\nquashing the complaint.\\nPage 9 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\n11. The petitioner has also relied upon following\\ndecisions – (1) T.T. Antony Vs.State of Kerala\\nreported in (2001)6 SCC 181, which confirms\\nthat second FIR for the same set of\\nallegations is nothing, but clear abuse of\\nprocess of law and indicates malafide action.\\nThereby there cannot be second FIR and, thus,\\nno fresh investigation on receipt of every\\nsubsequent information in respect of the same\\ncognizable offence or same occurrence giving\\nrise to one or more cognizable offences. It is\\ncertain that first instance of information\\nabout the commission of cognizable offence\\neither before the police or before the\\nMetropolitan Magistrate is to be treated as\\ncomplaint and all such subsequent informations\\nwill be covered by Section 162 of the Cr.P.C.\\nand, therefore, as provided u/s.173 of the\\nCr.P.C., if investigating agency or the\\ncompetent Authority comes across any further\\ninformation pertaining to the same incident,\\nnormally with the leave of the Court, such\\ninformation pertaining to the same incident is\\nto be forwarded to the Court as further\\nevidence, if any collected, with further\\nreport/reports u/s.178(8). Though such\\nprocedure relates to the investigation of both\\nthe complaints by the police, the legal\\nposition cannot be altered or changed that\\nthere cannot be two separate complaints for\\nPage 10 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nthe same set of allegations and more\\nparticularly when the complainant is one and\\ncommon and once they have filed a complaint\\nunder the Companies Act before the competent\\nCourt, if the complainant is of the opinion\\nthat similar set of allegations also\\nconstitute other offences under any other\\nenactments, then also, they are free to\\nfurnish such information to the same Court, to\\nconsider the further proceedings with such\\nadditional information, but law does not\\npermit to file separate complaint raising\\nidentical allegations in the complaint.\\n12. The petitioner also relies upon the case of\\nSagar Suri and Anr.Vs.State of U.P. & Ors.\\nreported in 2000 SCC (Cri.) 513, which is\\nrepeatedly referred and followed by the Apex\\nCourt in several decisions (AIR 2010 SC 3363 –\\nPreeti Gupta Vs.State of Jharkhand, AIR 2011 SC\\n2552 – Bhajan Singh Vs.State of Haryana and AIR\\n2010 SC (Supp.) 347 – Md.Ibrahim Vs.State of\\nBihar) and the outcome of such decisions can\\nbe summarised in following words.\\n“It is the duty and obligation of the criminal\\nCourt to exercise a great deal of caution in\\nissuing the process particularly when matters\\nare essentially of civil in nature.”\\n“Prompt and early reporting of the occurrence\\nby the informant with all its vivid details\\ngives an assurance regarding its true version.\\nIn case, there is some delay in filing the\\nPage 11 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nFIR, the complainant must give explanation for\\nthe same. Undoubtedly, delay in lodging the\\nFIR does not make the complainant's case\\nimprobable when such delay is properly\\nexplained. However, deliberate delay in\\nlodging the complaint may prove to be fatal.\\nIn such case of delay, it also cannot be\\npresumed that the allegations were an after\\nthought or had given a coloured version of\\nevents. The court has to carefully examine the\\nfacts before it, for the reason, that the\\ncomplainant party may initiate criminal\\nproceedings just to harass the other side with\\nmala fide intentions or with ulterior motive\\nof wreaking vengeance. The court proceedings\\nought not to be permitted to degenerate into a\\nweapon of harassment and persecution. In such\\na case, where an FIR is lodged clearly with a\\nview to spite the other party because of a\\nprivate and personal grudge and to enmesh the\\nother party in long and arduous criminal\\nproceedings, the court may take a view that it\\namounts to an abuse of the process of law.”\\n“The Apex Court has time and again drawn\\nattention to the growing tendency of\\ncomplainants attempting to give the cloak of a\\ncriminal offence to matters which are\\nessentially and purely civil in nature,\\nobviously either to apply pressure on the\\naccused, or out of enmity towards the accused,\\nor to subject the accused to harassment.\\nCriminal courts should ensure that proceedings\\nbefore it are not used for settling scores or\\nto pressurise parties to settle civil\\ndisputes. But at the same, it should be noted\\nthat several disputes of a civil nature may\\nalso contain the ingredients of criminal\\noffences and if so, will have to be tried as\\ncriminal offences, even if they also amount to\\ncivil disputes.”\\n13. The petitioner has also relied upon the case\\nof State of Haryana Vs.Bhajanlal & Ors.\\nPage 12 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nreported in AIR 1992 SC 604, order dated\\n13.4.1994 passed in Misc.Criminal Appln.No.2123\\nof 1990 of this Court, (2010)8 SCC 524, AIR\\n2011 SC 1090, (2010)158 Company Case 21 (AP),\\nthe sum and substance of all above reported\\ncases are common to the effect that there\\ncannot be a second FIR for the same offences;\\ncomplaint filed after couple of years cannot\\nbe entertained and person who has resigned as\\na Director cannot be held responsible or\\nliable for the activities of the company after\\nhis resignation. So far as the allegations\\nregarding cheating etc. are concerned, the\\nApex Court has specifically confirmed that\\nprimary requirement to make out an offence of\\ncheating u/s.415 punishable u/s.420 of the IPC\\nis dishonest/fraud intention at the time of\\ninducement is made and, therefore, in the\\ngiven case, the Apex Court has held that when\\nappellant ceased to be a Director of the\\ncompany from 27.12.1997 and when alleged\\noffences, if any, were stated to be committed\\nduring the period from 24.5.1998 to 17.9.1999,\\nit was held that the appellant before the\\nSupreme Court cannot be held responsible for\\nany activities of the company after he ceased\\nto be a Director of the company. The Supreme\\nCourt has further considered that company had\\ninvited the investment from the depositors to\\ninvest in the business/benefit funds after\\nPage 13 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\nreceiving due approval of the scheme from the\\nReserve Bank of India and, therefore, in any\\nevent, the element of cheating as alleged\\ncannot be made out and, therefore, it was held\\nthat appellant before the Supreme Court cannot\\nbe compelled to face the criminal prosecution.\\nThus, the Apex Court has set-aside the\\njudgment of the High Court and quashed the\\ncriminal proceedings.\\n14. We are having similar situation in the present\\ncase and, therefore, I do not hesitate to held\\nthat the impugned FIR is required to be\\nquashed for the reason that the allegations\\nare for the year 1999 onwards only whereas\\npetitioner has resigned in the year 1997,\\nimpugned FIR is second one and more\\nparticularly complainant/respondent No.2 was\\nvery much aware about the activities of the\\ncompany right from the year 1996, but they\\nwaited till the year 2002 – 2003 and tried to\\nharass the petitioner by not disclosing the\\ncorrect information to the police while filing\\nthe impugned FIR, therefore, the petition\\ndeserves to be allowed.\\n15. The petition is allowed as prayed for.\\nThereby, the FIR being C.R.No.I-861 of 2003\\npending with the Navrangpura Police Station\\nupon complaint by the present respondent No.2\\non 23.9.2003, is hereby quashed against\\nPage 14 of 15\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 16:28:54 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nR/CR.MA/1032/2007 JUDGEMENT\\nundefined\\npresent petition.

Save and except\\nthe above two submissions, no other submissions are\\ncanvassed by the learned advocate for the appellant-\\nInsurance Company. Thus, the learned advocate submitted\\nthat considering the entire gamut of evidence adduced\\nbefore the learned Commissioner, the appellant has made\\nout a case for interference in the appeal and the appeal\\nrequires to be allowed, and the order passed by the\\nlearned Commissioner requires to be quashed and set\\naside. Learned advocate for the appellant has also\\nplaced reliance on the judgment in the case of DEVKI\\nFABRICS LTD. vs. RAIBEN w/o MAFATLAL GANGARAM PATEL &\\nANR. reported in 2006 III CLR 487.\\nAs against the aforesaid submissions, Mr. Balram\\nJain, the learned counsel representing the claimant\\nsubmitted that the Commissioner has not committed any\\nerror in awarding compensation to the claimant.

He further\\nsubmitted that the learned Commissioner has also\\nconsidered the evidence adduced by both the sides and\\narrived at the finding that the original claimant is\\nrequired to be paid Rs.4,38,280/- as he was dependent on\\ndeceased Mahadeva Jesa Koli and Gitaben Mahadeva Koli who\\ndied during the course of employment with the respondents\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 18:21:50 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nFA/1087/2007 4/11 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nNo. 1 and 2.

The learned Commissioner has in great detail\\ndiscussed about the contention which was raised by the\\nappellant Insurance Company that out of 66 workmen, only\\napplications of 17 workmen were allowed and the rest of\\nthe applications were dismissed, and since the\\napplication preferred by the present claimant is not\\naccording to the policy which prescribes maximum limit of\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 18:21:50 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nFA/1087/2007 5/11 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\n40, the same cannot be considered. The learned\\nCommissioner has infact discussed the aspect with regard\\nto the dismissal of 49 applications and came to the\\nconclusion that the Insurance Company has not adduced\\nnecessary evidence in respect thereof and, therefore, the\\ncontention raised by the Insurance Company cannot be\\naccepted. There is no reason to interfere with this\\nfinding arrived at by the learned Commissioner and since\\nonly 17 applications were allowed, the present\\napplication preferred by the legal heir of deceased\\nMahadeva Jesa Koli and Gitaben Mahadeva Koli, in my\\nconsidered view, requires to be allowed as per the\\nInsurance Policy, a copy of which is produced along with\\nthe appeal for my perusal. The learned Commissioner has\\nconsidered the evidence on record of the case, the age\\nand income of the deceased and the loss which is likely\\nto be suffered by the claimant while awarding\\ncompensation of Rs.4,38,280/- for death of the deceased\\nworkman as a result of the cyclonic storm.\\nThe second contention on behalf of the appellant\\nInsurance Company is that it is not liable to pay penalty\\nand interest.\\nIn view of the settled legal position that the\\nInsurance Company is not liable to pay penalty, Mr. Jain\\nhas not seriously pressed this contention. However, with\\nregard to interest, Mr. Jain submitted that the Insurance\\nCompany is liable to pay interest to the claimants in\\nview of the decisions of the Honourable Supreme Court in\\nthe case of New India Assurance Co.

Mr. Jain submitted that in\\nview of the ratio laid down by the Honourable Supreme\\nCourt, the Insurance Company cannot wriggle out from the\\nliability to pay interest.\\nI have carefully considered the judgments sited by\\nlearned advocate Mr. Jain. However, before dealing with\\nthe same, it would be beneficial to consider the ratio\\nlaid down by the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of\\nNEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. V/s. HARSHADBHAI AMRUTBHAI\\nMODHIYA reported in 2006 ACJ 1699. The said case arose\\nout of a Workmen's Compensation Policy and the question\\nbefore the Apex Court was exactly similar to the one in\\nthe present case which the Apex Court has recorded in\\nparagraph 2 as under:\\n“2. Whether interest is payable by an\\ninsurer while indemnifying the insured the\\namount of compensation awarded against him under\\nWorkmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (for short 'the\\nAct') is the question involved in this\\nappeal ...”\\nAfter considering the scheme of Workmen's\\nCompensation Act and the Insurance Act, the Apex Court\\nheld as under in paragraphs 14,15,16, 18, 19 and 21:\\n“14. By reason of the provisions of the Act, an\\nemployer is not statutorily liable to enter into a\\ncontract of insurance. Where, however, a contract of\\ninsurance is entered into by and between the\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 18:21:50 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nFA/1087/2007 7/11 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\nemployer and the insurer, the insurer shall be\\nliable to indemnify the employer. The insurer,\\nhowever, unlike under the provisions of the Motor\\nVehicles Act, does not have a statutory liability.\\nSection 17 of the Act does not provide for any\\nrestriction in the matter of contracting out by the\\nemployer vis-a-vis the insurer.\\n15. The terms of a contract of insurance would\\ndepend upon the volition of the parties. A contract\\nof insurance is governed by the provisions of the\\nInsurance Act. In terms of the provisions of the\\nInsurance Act, an insured is bound to pay premium\\nwhich is to be calculated in the manner provided for\\ntherein. With a view to minimize his liability, an\\nemployer can contract out so as to make the insurer\\nnot liable as regards indemnifying him in relation\\nto certain matters which do not strictly arise out\\nof the mandatory provisions of any statute.\\nContracting out, as regards payment of interest by\\nan employer, therefore, is not prohibited in law.\\n16. In Ved Prakash Gard, 1998 ACJ 1 (SC), this\\nCourt undoubtedly held that in terms of the contract\\nof insurance entered into by and between the\\nemployer and the insurer under the provisions of the\\nMotor Vehicles Act, 1988, which would also apply in\\na given case to the claim under the provisions of\\nWorkmen's Compensation Act, the insurer would also\\nbe liable for payment of interest stating :\\nxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx\\nDownloaded on : Wed Apr 10 18:21:50 IST 2024NEUTRAL CITATION\\nFA/1087/2007 8/11 JUDGMENT\\nundefined\\n18. We are, in this case, not concerned with a case\\nwhere accident has occurred by use of a motor\\nvehicle in respect whereof the contract of insurance\\nwould be governed by the provisions of the Motor\\nVehicles Act, 1988.\\n19. As indicated hereinbefore, a contract of\\ninsurance is governed by the provisions of the\\nInsurance Act. Unless the said contract is governed\\nby the provisions of a statute, the parties are free\\nto enter into a contract as for their own volition.\\nThe Act does not contain a provision like section\\n147 of Motor Vehicles Act. Where a statute does not\\nprovide for a compulsory insurance or the extent\\nthereof, it will bear repetition to state, the\\nparties are free to choose their own terms of\\ncontract. In that view of the matter, contracting\\nout, so far as reimbursement of amount of interest\\nis concerned, in our opinion, is not prohibited by a\\nstatute.\\nxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx\\n21. For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned\\njudgment cannot be sustained. It is set aside\\naccordingly. The appeal is allowed. The appellant\\nis not liable for the interest.

The terms and\\nconditions of the insurance policy under Motor Vehicles\\nAct and the coverage of risk in such cases are altogether\\ndifferent from Workmen's Compensation Policy. Therefore,\\nthe ratio laid down by the Apex Court in the aforesaid\\ntwo judgments have no bearing in the present case which\\npertains to Workmen's Compensation Policy, more\\nparticularly in view of paragraph 19 of the judgment of\\nthe Apex Court in the case of NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO.\\nLTD. V/s. HARSHADBHAI AMRUTBHAI MODHIYA.\\nThere is also no dispute with the ratio laid down by\\nthe Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Maghar Singh\\nv/s. Jashwant Singh reported in (1998) 9 SCC 134. The\\nsaid litigation was between two private individuals, a\\nfarm labour and his employer, and the Apex Court held\\nthat the employer is liable to pay interest. In the\\npresent case, the question involved is whether the\\nInsurance Company would be liable to pay interest or not.\\nTherefore, the ratio laid down in the said judgment is of\\nno avail to the learned advocate.\\nAs regards the judgment in the case of L.R. Ferro\\nAlloys Ltd. V/s.

In the said\\ncase, perhaps, the terms of the contract of insurance did\\nnot exclude payment of interest. However, in the present\\ncase, the insurer has specifically excluded any liability\\nfor interest or penalty under the Workmen's Compensation\\nAct and confined its liability to indemnify the employer\\nonly against the amount of compensation ordered to be\\npaid under Workmen's Compensation Act. In view of the\\nspecific exclusion, this judgment is also of no avail to\\nthe learned advocate.\\nIn the instant case, the policy specifically\\nprovides that the Insurance Company is not liable to pay\\ninterest and/or penalty imposed on the insured on account\\nof his/their failure to comply with the requirements as\\nlaid down under the Act. Therefore, in the light of the\\nratio laid down by the Apex Court in the case of NEW\\nINDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. V/S. HARSHADBHAI AMRUTBHAI\\nMODHIYA [supra], the appellant Insurance Company cannot\\nbe fastened with the liability to pay penalty and\\ninterest.\\nIn view of the above discussions, the appeal is\\npartly allowed.

However, the award of interest at 12% from\\n09.06.98 till the date of payment and Rs.2,19,140/-\\nbeing 50% penalty, qua the appellant, is hereby quashed\\nand set aside.

No.1214 (W) of 2009\\nDr. Ashok Kumar Sinha\\n…Petitioner\\nVersus\\nUnion of India & ors.\\n... Respondents\\nMr. P.K. Munshi\\n…for the petitioner\\nMr. Anirban Bose\\nMs. Aparajita Ghosh\\n… for the respondents\\nHeard on : 4.2.2009\\nJudgment on : 6.2.2009\\nThe petitioner is presently employed as Assistant Director of Ali Yavar Jung\\nNational Institute for the Hearing Handicapped (hereafter the Institute) in its\\neastern regional office at Kolkata. By responding to an advertisement dated\\n25.2.2007 inviting applications for appointment to the post of Deputy Director\\n(Tech) of the Institute, the petitioner had offered his candidature vide application\\ndated 31.12.2007. The petitioner was called upon to attend an interview on19.11.2008 at Bangalore, Karnataka. There is no specific pleading as to whether\\nthe petitioner attended the interview or not but from the tenor of the petition it\\nseems that he had participated in such interview. He is aggrieved by office order\\ndated 24.11.2008 issued by the Director of the Institute whereby the respondent\\nno.4 was appointed as Deputy Director (Tech) of the Institute from 29.11.2008.\\nIn the petition, the process of selection leading to selection of the\\nrespondent no.4 and her consequent appointment as Deputy Director (Tech) of\\nthe Institute is the subject matter of challenge on various grounds as urged\\ntherein.\\nAt the outset, learned Counsel appearing for the Institute has objected to\\nmaintainability of the writ petition. According to him, neither the respondents\\nhave their offices in West Bengal nor has the petitioner pleaded that part cause of\\naction has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. Accordingly, the\\nwrit petition is not maintainable and ought to be dismissed.\\nMr. Munshi, learned Counsel representing the petitioner, contended that\\nthe petitioner had responded to the advertisement inviting applications for the\\npost in question from Kolkata and that he also derived knowledge of the\\nrespondent no.4 being appointed as Deputy Director (Tech) in Kolkata and,\\ntherefore, part cause of action for filing the present petition has arisen within the\\nterritorial jurisdiction of this Court and hence this petition is maintainable.\\nThis Court is afraid, the contention of Mr. Munshi is not at all convincing.\\nThe petitioner is aggrieved because the respondent no.4 has been selected for\\nappointment to the post of Deputy Director (Tech). According to him, he wasbetter qualified for the post of Deputy Director (Tech) in comparison to the\\nrespondent no.4 and the Selection Committee by overlooking his claim has acted\\nillegally and unreasonably. In proceedings for judicial review, the Court of Writ is\\nnot concerned with the decision but reviews the decision making process leading\\nto the ultimate decision. It is not in dispute at the bar that interview for\\nappointment to the post of Deputy Director (Tech) was conducted in Bangalore\\nand the impugned office order was issued from Bombay. The comparative\\nanalysis of the merits and demerits of the candidates who expressed interest for\\nappointment to the post in question must have taken place either in Bangalore or\\nin Bombay. Even if that is not so, there is no averment in the petition that it took\\nplace within West Bengal. In the considered view of this Court, mere sending of\\napplication from Kolkata or coming to learn of the respondent no.4’s appointment\\nin Kolkata would not clothe this Court with jurisdiction to entertain the writ\\npetition in the absence of either the decision to appoint the respondent no.4\\nbeing taken or any substantial part of the decision making process leading to\\nsuch decision having occurred within its territorial limits. The decision that the\\nrespondent no.4 was best suited for the post in question cannot therefore be\\nchallenged before this Court. Sending of application from Kolkata by the\\npetitioner is not an integral part of the cause of action which is required to be\\nproved by him for obtaining relief from Court and, therefore, it is held that no\\npart of cause of action for which the petitioner feels aggrieved having arisen\\nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, this petition is not maintainable.\\nThe writ petition stands dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.Dismissal of this petition shall, however, not preclude the petitioner from\\napproaching the appropriate Court, if so advised.\\nUrgent photostat certified copy of this judgment, if applied for, be\\nfurnished to the applicant within 4 days from date of putting in requisites\\ntherefor.\\n(DIPANKAR DATTA, J.)',\n",

WP No. 1846 (W) of\\n2009 is dismissed without any order as to costs and the petitioners are permitted\\nto proceed with WP No. 2344 (W) of 2009.\\nCAN No. 1350 of 2009 is an application for the applicant to be impleaded\\nin WP No. 2344 (W) of 2009. The applicant proposes to come on board to resist\\nthe reliefs claimed in the petition.\\nThe petitioner company was engaged by the West Bengal Power\\nDevelopment Corporation Limited (the corporation) for removal of fly ash from the\\nKolaghat Thermal Power Station of the corporation. The letter of intent of\\nDecember 19, 2005 specified that the petitioner company was to remove 29,000\\nMT of fly ash per month with a provision for variation on either side to the extent\\nof 25 per cent. The third clause of the letter of intent provided as follows:\\n“3) Time of completion: Two (2) calendar year since 1.1.06 with provision\\nfor further extension for a period of one more year depending upon\\nsatisfactory performance by you within which time between 1.1.06 till\\nexecution of formal MOU at future course of time is to be considered as\\nSTABILISATION PERIOD to facilitate instant execution of work.”The petitioners say that the clause implied that the period of two years\\nwith an additional period of a further year would begin to run after the formal\\nexecution of a memorandum of understanding. The petitioners say that a draft\\nmemorandum was forwarded by the corporation to the petitioner company which\\nwas duly executed on behalf of the company and returned to the corporation, but\\nthe corporation has chosen to not complete the execution of the document. The\\npetitioners say that in such view of the matter – and since it is admitted that the\\nmemorandum of understanding has not yet been executed – the petitioner\\ncompany’s tenure continues and there is no question of any new invitation being\\nissued for fresh offers for another period. The petitioners assail the notice dated\\nJanuary 27, 2009 and say that the job description therein of “procuring of\\nbalance quantity of coal ash …” would convey the impression that the offers\\nbeing invited would be for fly ash beyond the monthly quantum of 29,000 MT\\nreserved for the petitioner company. The petitioners say that if such is the case,\\nthey would have no grievance and on a clarification to such effect being offered\\nby the corporation, the petitioners would not pursue these proceedings. The\\npetitioners, however, say that the relevant clause is somewhat ambiguous and it\\nis the petitioners’ apprehension that without the corporation clarifying that the\\npetitioners’ monthly quantum was to be left untouched, there is room for the\\ncorporation to take steps to the detriment of the petitioner company.\\nThe corporation says that a firm date was given to the petitioners and\\nunless the corporation enlarges the time, the petitioners have no right to obtain\\nthe fly ash from the Kolaghat Thermal Plant for an indefinite period. The\\napplicant seeking to be impleaded suggests that it is the favourable rate that the\\npetitioner company has fortuitously obtained that entices the petitioners to try\\nand cling on to the work and keep other prospective bidders like the applicant at\\nbay.The petitioners have referred to the certificates issued by the corporation\\npersonnel to the petitioners appearing at pages 53 and 106 of the petition to\\nsubmit that there was no grievance as to the petitioners’ functioning. The\\npetitioners say that the stray complaint which finds place in the corporation’s\\nletter of November 26, 2008 has been dealt with in substance by the petitioners’\\nletter of December 2, 2008; and that, given the constraints, the petitioner\\ncompany had performed remarkably to remove adequate quantities of fly ash\\nevery month.\\nIt is not necessary to enter into the arena of satisfactory performance or\\notherwise by the petitioner company. The substance of the claim hinges on the\\nmeaning of the third clause in the letter of intent. If such clause is seen to have\\ngiven the petitioner a minimum time of two years after the execution of the\\nmemorandum of understanding, the petitioners would be right in their assertion\\nthat the tenure continues and the countdown to the minimum two-year period\\nhas not yet commenced.\\nIn the papers that the petitioners have brought, there is a submission that\\nis attributed to the petitioners in an order dated January 15, 2009. The applicant\\nintending to be impleaded here had instituted WP No. 32060 (W) of 2008,\\napparently aggrieved by the corporation not inviting any fresh offers for the\\nremoval of fly ash from the Kolaghat Thermal Plant. On December 24, 2008 the\\ncorporation submitted that it proposed to issue a fresh tender notice in January,\\n2009 for the purpose. Upon such submission being recorded, no interim order\\nwas passed but the petition was kept pending. The present writ petitioners filed\\nCAN No. 242 of 2009 seeking to be impleaded in WP No. 32060 (W) of 2008. On\\nsuch application being taken up on January 15, 2009, a submission was made\\non behalf of the present writ petitioners to the following effect:\\n“The applicants say that the applicants are entitled to continue the work\\ntill 2010 and submit that they are necessary parties. …”Since it is the undisputed position that the memorandum of understanding\\nhas not been executed yet, if the petitioners’ understanding was that the period\\nof minimum of two years was to begin after the document was formalised such\\nsubmission that the contract was to last till 2010 could not have been made.\\nAgain, and notwithstanding the complaint relating to the petitioner company’s\\nperformance having been dealt with in its letter of December 2, 2008, the\\nprincipal assertion in the corporation’s letter of November 26, 2008 remains\\nunrebutted. Such letter extended the time under the letter of intent till February\\n28, 2009 and emphasised that upon expiry of such extended period, the\\narrangement would stand determined. If, indeed, it was the petitioners’\\nunderstanding that the period of two years was only to commence upon the\\nexecution of the memorandum of understanding, the petitioners ought to have\\ndropped a line in protest following due receipt of the letter of November 26, 2008.\\nThe relevant clause in the letter of intent is not happily worded but the\\nvague words would have to be stretched a considerable distance for the clause to\\nimply what the petitioners now seek to establish. There is no document dated\\nprior to the institution of the present round of proceedings from which it would\\nbe evident that the parties shared the petitioners’ view on the relevant clause or\\nthat the petitioner company had expressed its understanding of the clause on the\\nlines that the petitioners have canvassed now. It does not appear from the\\nconduct of the petitioners following the receipt of the letter of November 26, 2008\\nthat even a couple of months before coming to court the petitioners read the third\\nclause in the letter of intent in the manner that they now wish it to be read.\\nThere is nothing arbitrary about the corporation inviting fresh offers for the\\nremoval of fly ash from the Kolaghat Thermal Plant. The corporation has also\\nassured that the implication of the word “balance” appearing in its notice inviting\\ntender dated January 27, 2009 would be apparent from the tender documents\\nthat have gone on sale today.There is no merit in the petition. WP No. 2344 (W) of 2009 is dismissed\\nwithout any order as to costs. CAN No. 1350 of 2009 stands disposed of without\\ncosts.\\nUrgent certified photostat copies of this judgment, if applied for, be\\nsupplied to the parties upon compliance with all requisite formalities.\\n(Sanjib Banerjee, J.)',\n",

The\\nchallenge herein is to the transfer of policemen from\\nvarious Districts. It has been stated by Mr. Srimani that\\non the same issue this Court has already dismissed the\\nwrit petition being W. P. 2311 (W) of 2009 on 13th\\nFebruary, 2009 after noticing number of judgments of\\nthe Supreme Court.\\nWe have considered the submissions made by the\\nlearned counsel. Repeatedly law has been laid down by\\nthe Supreme Court that it is incumbent on the High\\nCourt to satisfy itself with regard to the bona fides of the\\nwrit petition. It is also necessary for the High Court to\\nensure that frivolous and vexatious public interest writ\\npetitions are not entertained specially at the instance of\\nthe petitioners which fail to establish the necessary\\ncredentials for espousing the cause in public interest. In\\nthe present case, the petitioners claim to be Asian Frontof Human Rights. It claims to be a registered\\norganization. Its stated functions are “to look after the\\nsafety, security and convenience of the public and give\\nnecessary assistance in the event of violation of human\\nrights.” The petitioners claim to have fought for the\\ncause of the people on several occasions by making\\nrepresentations to the police authorities, statutory\\nbodies and other institutions as well as by filing public\\ninterest litigation petitions. The immediate cause for the\\nfiling of the writ petition as stated in paragraph 5 of the\\nwrit petition is that people of Santipur town Chapra,\\nGagnapur and Nakashipara of Nadia district met the\\nSecretary of the Society, i.e., petitioner no. 2 and made a\\nrepresentation that the police authorities are not looking\\ninto their grievances and are not taking any steps for\\npreventing the breach of peace solely for the reasons that\\nthey will be transferred outside the district of Nadia by\\n28th February, 2009. It is not disputed before us by the\\nlearned counsel Mr. Chatterjee appearing for the\\npetitioners that all the transfers have actually been\\neffected. The mobilization of police personnel from one\\nstation to another has been completed. This writ\\npetition, it is stated, has been filed only to ensure that\\nthe grievances of the individual police officers are duly\\nconsidered by the competent authority, i.e., the Chief\\nElectoral Officer. It is also submitted before us by the\\nlearned counsel that pending criminal cases are not\\nbeing investigated due to the transfer.\\nMr. Srimani has submitted that this writ petition is\\nnot maintainable as the petitioners have failed toestablish their locus standi. The petitioner no. 1 is a\\npurely voluntary organization and solicits\\nrepresentations from the locality just to justify its\\nexistence. The writ petition has been filed only to justify\\nits continuance as an N.G.O. It has no legal authority to\\ntake up the cause of the transferred police personnel.\\nIndividual remedies are available to any aggrieved Police\\nOfficial.\\nWe have considered the submissions made by the\\nlearned counsel for the parties. We are not satisfied with\\nthe bona fides of the writ petitioner in filing the present\\nwrit petition, nor are we satisfied with the locus standi of\\nthe writ petitioner in filing the writ petition. A perusal of\\nthe Petition shows that petitioners have given no details\\nas to:\\ni) With whom the petitioners are registered;\\nii) For what purposes is it registered;\\niii) What is the legal status of such a registration;\\niv) What is the administrative set up of the\\npetitioners;\\nv) Who provides the finances;\\nvi) What other social causes related to the protection\\nof the Fundamental Rights of poor or the deprived\\nsections of the society have been espoused by the\\npetitioners.\\nThat apart we are unable to rule out the possibility\\nthat the writ petition may have been filed for ulterior\\nmotives, given the proximity of the ParliamentaryElections. The writ petition could also be filed at the\\nbehest of some disgruntled police personnel who may\\nhave particular interest to cling on to a particular\\nlocality or a particular case. Therefore, it would be\\nwholly inappropriate to entertain the writ petition. We\\nfind support for this view from a number of judgments of\\nthe Supreme Court. We may mention here only a few. In\\nthe case of Janata Dal –vs- H. S. Chowdhury reported\\nin (1992) 4 SCC 305 it has been observed as follows :-\\n“109. It is thus clear that only a person acting\\nbona fide and having sufficient interest in the\\nproceedings of PIL will alone have a locus standi\\nand can approach the court to wipe out the tears\\nof the poor and needy, suffering from violation of\\ntheir fundamental rights but not a person for\\npersonal gain or private profit or political motive or\\nany oblique consideration. Similarly a vexation\\npetition under the colour of PIL brought before the\\ncourt for vindicating any personal grievance,\\ndeserves rejection at the threshold.”\\nIn the case of Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware –vs- State\\nof Maharashtra reported in (2005) 1 SCC 590 wherein\\nit has been held as follows :-\\n“11. It is depressing to note that on account of\\nsuch trumpery proceedings initiated before the\\ncourts, innumerable days are wasted, which time\\notherwise could have been spent for the disposal of\\ncases of genuine litigants. Though we spare no\\nefforts in fostering and developing the laudableconcept of PIL and extending our long arm of\\nsympathy to the poor, the ignorant the oppressed\\nand the needy whose fundamental rights are\\ninfringed and violated and whose grievances go\\nunnoticed, unrepresented and unheard; yet, we\\ncannot avoid but express our opinion that while\\ngenuine litigants with legitimate grievances relating\\nto civil matters involving properties worth hundreds\\nof millions of rupees and criminal cases in which\\npersons sentenced to death facing the gallows\\nunder untold agony and persons sentenced to life\\nimprisonment and kept in incarceration for long\\nyears, persons suffering from undue delay in\\nservice matters – government or private, persons\\nawaiting the disposal of cases wherein huge\\namounts of public revenue or unauthorized\\ncollection of tax amounts are locked up, detenus\\nexpecting their release from detention orders etc.\\nare all standing in a long serpentine queue for\\nyears with the fond hope of getting into the courts\\nand having their grievances redressed, busybodies,\\nmeddlesome interlopers, wayfarers or officious\\ninterveners having absolutely no public interest\\nexcept for personal gain or private profit either of\\nthemselves or as a proxy of others or for any other\\nextraneous motivation or for glare of publicity,\\nbreak the queue muffling their faces by wearing the\\nmask of public interest litigation and get into the\\ncourts by filing vexatious and frivolous petitions\\nand thus criminally waste the valuable time of the\\ncourts and as a result of which the queue standingoutside the doors of the courts never moves, which\\npiquant situation creates frustration in the minds of\\ngenuine litigants and resultantly they lose faith in\\nthe administration of our judicial system.\\n12. Public interest litigation is a weapon which\\nhas to be used with great care and circumspection\\nand the judiciary has to be extremely careful to see\\nthat behind the beautiful veil of public interest, an\\nugly private malice, vested interest and/or publicity\\nseeking is not lurking. It is to be used as an\\neffective weapon in the armoury of law for\\ndelivering social justice to citizens. The attractive\\nbrand name of public interest litigation should not\\nbe used for suspicious products of mischief. It\\nshould be aimed at redressal of genuine public\\nwrong or public injury and not the publicity-oriented\\nor founded on personal vendetta. As indicated\\nabove, court must be careful to see that a body of\\npersons or member of the public, who approaches\\nthe Court is acting bona fide and not for personal\\ngain or private motive or political motivation or other\\noblique considerations. The court must not allow its\\nprocess to be abused for oblique considerations by\\nmasked phantoms who monitor at times from\\nbehind. Some persons with vested interest indulge\\nin the pastime of meddling with judicial process\\neither by force of habit or from improper motives\\nand try to bargain for a good deal as well as to\\nenrich themselves. Often they are actuated by a\\ndesire to win notoriety or cheap popularity. Thepetitions of such busybodies deserved to be thrown\\nout by rejection at the threshold, and in appropriate\\ncases with exemplary costs.\\n14. The court has to be satisfied about (a) the\\ncredentials of the applicant; (b) the prima facie\\ncorrectness of nature of information given by him;\\n(c) the information being not vague and indefinite.\\nThe information should show gravity and\\nseriousness involved. Court has to strike a balance\\nbetween two conflicting interests : (i) nobody should\\nbe allowed to indulge in wild and reckless\\nallegations besmirching the character of others; and\\n(ii) avoidance of public mischief and to avoid\\nmischievous petitions seeking to assail, for oblique\\nmotives, justifiable executive actions. In such case,\\nhowever, the court cannot afford to be liberal. It has\\nto be extremely careful to see that under the guise\\nof redressing a public grievance, it does not\\nencroach upon the sphere reserved by the\\nConstitution to the executive and the legislature.\\nThe court has to act ruthlessly while dealing with\\nimposters and busybodies or meddlesome\\ninterlopers impersonating as public-spirited holy\\nmen. They masquerade as crusaders of justice.\\nThey pretended to act in the name of pro bono\\npublico, though they have no interest of the public\\nor even of their own to protect.”In the case of Common Cause ( A Regd. Society) –\\nvs- Union of India reported in (2008) 5 SCC 511\\nwherein it has been held as follows :-\\n“59. Unfortunately, the truth is that PILs dare\\nbeing entertained by many courts as a routine and\\nthe result is that the dockets of most of the superior\\ncourts are flooded with PILs, most of which are\\nfrivolous or for which the judiciary has no remedy.\\nAs stated in Duttaraj Nathuji Thaware case [(2005)\\n1 SCC 590] public interest litigation has nowadays\\nlargely become ‘public interest litigation’, ‘private\\ninterest litigation’, or ‘politics interest litigation’ or\\nthe latest trend ‘paise income litigation’. Much of PIL\\nis really blackmail.\\n60. Thus, public interest litigation which was\\ninitially created as a useful judicial tool to help the\\npoor and weaker section of society who could not\\nafford to come to courts, has, in course of time,\\nlargely developed into an uncontrollable\\nFrankenstein and a nuisance which is threatening\\nto choke the dockets of the superior courts\\nobstructing the hearing of the genuine and regular\\ncases which have been waiting to be taken up for\\nyears together.”\\nKeeping in view of the aforesaid ratio of law laid down\\nby the Supreme Court, we are not satisfied that the\\npresent writ petition is either bona fide or likely to serve\\nany public interest. Any transfer made of any publicservant cannot ever leave a vacuum, as the transferred\\nofficers have to be replaced by the substitutes from some\\nother place. If such a submission of Mr. Chatterjee is to\\nbe accepted, no transfer orders could ever be effected.\\nIndividual remedy is available to any Police Officer,\\nwho may wish to claim that the transfer is in\\ncontravention of the Circular dated 4.2.2009. This\\ncircuitous route of filing the Public Interest Litigation\\ncannot be accepted, nor can it be encouraged. In our\\nopinion, the frivolous and vexacious writ petitions\\ndisguised as Public Interest Litigation have to be nipped\\nin the bud. These petitioners cannot be permitted to eat\\ninto the time which the Court needs to spend on\\nexamination of the genuine grievances of the genuine\\nlitigants, in bona fide litigation. On an examination of\\nthe entire material, we are satisfied that the Writ Petition\\nhas to be dismissed at the thresh-hold, so that the\\nvaluable time of the Court is not wasted.\\nWith the above observations, the writ petition is\\ndismissed.\\n(SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, C.J.)\\n(BISWANATH SOMADDER, J.)',\n",

It appears that the\\nTitle Suit Nos. 271 of 1994 and 160 of 1999 were filed by the\\nplaintiffs/respondents against the appellant and others. The learned Civil\\nJudge (Senior Division), 7th Court, Alipore disposed of both the suits\\nanalogously and passed the decree in favour of the plaintiffs/respondents. In\\nTitle Suit No. 271 of 1994 the respondent No. 1 along with her sisters filed the\\nsuit against their brother, the defendant No. 1 and some others including the\\ndefendant No. 5, the present appellant with a prayer for partition and\\naccount. The other suit, Title Suit No. 160 of 1999 was filed by the\\nrespondent No. 1 along with one of her sister wherein the present appellant\\nwas the principal defendant and the plaintiff’s other sisters and brother were\\nimpleaded as proforma defendants.Case of the plaintiff/respondent is that late Harendra Kumar Saha, the\\nfather of the principal parties was the owner of the suit property and\\nsubsequently the plaintiffs and their brother who was the defendant No. 1 of\\nthe suit, became the owners of the said property having 1/4th share each.\\nDuring his life time Harendra Kumar Saha sold away his .08 decimals of\\ndemarcated land in favour of the proforma defendant No. 2 and proforma\\ndefendant nos. 3 to 5 acquired adverse possession in respect of demarcated\\nmore or less .02 decimals of land by virtue of the judgment as passed by the\\nlearned Additional District Judge, 3rd Court at Alipore, South 24-Parganas in\\nconnection with another suit being Title Suit No. 479 of 1972. It is the case of\\nthe plaintiffs that they approached their brother the defendant No. 1 to have\\namicable partition of the suit property, but he refused such proposal. According\\nto the plaintiffs, the area of the property in question is 23 decimals and area of\\nthe property for which prayer for partition was made was 13 decimals of land.\\nRest 10 decimals of the suit plot belonged to the proforma defendants and in\\norder to avoid any complication, they have been added as parties in the\\npartition suit.\\nThose proforma defendants did not contest the suit. However, the\\ndefendant No. 5, the appellant herein, contested the suit by filing written\\nstatement, wherein he denied the allegations of the plaintiff on material points.\\nThe contention of the said defendant No. 5/the appellant is that he is the ownerof 3 decimals of land by way of purchase and by way of acquisition of title by\\nadverse possession.\\nIn Title Suit No. 160 of 1999, the plaintiffs claimed that they and the\\nproforma defendants are the owners of the said property. The defendant No.1,\\nthe appellant herein, acquired title in respect of the ‘B’ Schedule property of the\\nsaid suit by way of adverse possession as per judgment of the Appellate Court\\npassed in Title Appeal No. 482 of 1972. However, the plaintiffs alleged that the\\ndefendant No. 1/appellant illegally erected a wall on the western side of the ‘A’\\nSchedule property and tried to make further construction thereon in the early\\npart of 1985. As such, Title Suit No. 19 of 1985 was filed against the said\\ndefendant No. 5/appellant. However, as the appellant removed the illegal\\nconstruction and gave undertaking not to interfere in the plaintiffs’ possession in\\nrespect of the suit property, so the plaintiff did not take any step and\\nconsequently said suit was dismissed for non-prosecution. In spite of that,\\nagain the defendant No. 1 /appellant constructed a wall and a privy in the\\nNorth-Western corner of the ‘A’ Schedule property and the plaintiffs came to\\nknow about this fact on 1.12.1990. As such, the plaintiffs/respondents had to\\nfile the said suit against the defendant No. 1/appellant praying for direction\\nupon the said appellant to remove the illegal construction.\\nThat suit was contested by the present appellant by filing written\\nstatement wherein the allegations as made in the plaint were denied. Accordingto the said defendant, the earlier suit being Title Suit No. 119 of 1969 was filed\\nonly in respect of ‘B’ Schedule property i.e. for 24’x9’ and not in respect of ‘A’\\nand ‘B’ schedule property and the learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court,\\nAlipore in his judgment in Title Appeal No. 480 of 1972 declared that defendants\\nacquired title in respect of 24’x9’ i.e. the ‘B’ Schedule property by way of adverse\\npossession. It does not mean that defendant No. 1/appellant had no title in\\nrespect of the ‘A’ Schedule. Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed Title Suit No. 19 of\\n1989 in respect of the ‘A’ Schedule property for the demolition of the boundary\\nwall which was constructed thereon. That suit was dismissed for non-\\nprosecution as the plaintiffs did not comply with the Court’s order. According to\\nthe defendant/appellant, the subsequent suit on the same subject matter is not\\nmaintainable. As such, the defendant/appellant prayed for dismissal of the suit.\\nUpon the above pleadings, learned Trial Court framed several issues and\\nrecorded the evidence of the parties and on perusal of the same and the\\nexhibited documents, he was pleased to decree both the suits in favour of the\\nplaintiffs/respondents. The defendant No. 1/appellant preferred a title appeal\\nand the learned Additional District Judge, Fast Track Court-II, Alipore by his\\njudgment dated 20.5.2005 disposed of both the appeals analogously and\\ndismissed the same. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said judgment of\\nthe learned First Appellate Court, the defendant/appellant has preferred this\\nsecond appeal. At the time of admission of the S.A.T. No. 660 of 2006 which wassubsequently numbered as S.A. 551 of 2008, the learned Division Bench was\\npleased to frame following substantial questions of law :-\\n1)In view of the fact that an earlier suit filed by the respondent over the\\nselfsame subject matter being Title Suit No. 19 of 1985 was dismissed under\\nOrder 9 Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure and no step was taken for\\nrestoration of the said suit, whether the subsequent suit filed by the plaintiff\\nover the selfsame property claiming the similar relief is barred under law;\\n2) Whether the learned Courts below committed substantial error of law in\\nrejecting the plea of adverse possession pleaded by the appellant by totally\\nrelying upon the recording in the revisional records of right by overlooking the\\nfact that in respect of the selfsame plot, a part of the property has been declared\\nto be owned by the defendant by way of adverse possession in an earlier suit and\\nthe presumption of correctness arising out of recording in the records of right\\nhad been rebutted in the previous suit in respect of the selfsame plot, though in\\nrespect of a different portion;\\n3) Whether the learned Courts below committed substantial error of law in not\\nconsidering the question of adverse possession in the light of the previous decree\\nin respect of a different portion of the same plot.It appears from the order dated 10.6.2008 that on consent of the learned\\nAdvocates for both the sides, it was decided that same substantial questions of\\nlaw were directed to be considered in the other second appeal being S.A. No. 229\\nof 2008, and as such there was no necessity for framing separate questions of\\nlaw. Accordingly, both the appeals were taken up for consideration on the basis\\nof those substantial questions of law.\\nIt is the case of the plaintiffs/respondents that the plaintiffs being the three\\nsisters and their brother the defendant No.1 each were 1/4th owner of the suit\\nproperty. This claim has not been disputed by the contesting\\ndefendant/appellant. The Title Suit No. 271 of 1994 was filed praying for\\npartition and accounts. It is pertinent to mention that the defendant No. 1, the\\nbrother of the plaintiffs/respondents did not contest the said suit. The defendant\\nNo. 5 only contested the said suit. It is the settled position that in order to get a\\ndecree for partition, the plaintiffs first of all are to establish that they are co-\\nowners in respect of the property. From the findings of both the Courts below ,\\nit appears that it was held that all the plaintiffs and their brother, the defendant\\nNo. 1 were the owners of the suit property. It has further been held concurrently\\nby both the Courts below that the suit properties were never partitioned in\\nbetween the co-owners and as such the plaintiffs were entitled to get a decree for\\npartition by metes and bounds. Although the defendant No. 5 contested the said\\nsuit for partition, but there is nothing on record to show that the said defendantNo. 5, the appellant herein, is one of the co-owner of the said suit property. As\\nsuch, I am of opinion that both the Courts below were perfectly justified in\\npassing the decree for partition in favour of the plaintiffs/respondents. In this\\nrespect, I do not find any scope for interference by this Court.\\nThe dispute actually arose in respect of other suit being Title Suit No. 160\\nof 1999 wherein the plaintiffs prayed for declaration of their title in respect of the\\n‘B’ Schedule property and for permanent injunction. From the R.S. record of\\nrights as well as from the evidence on record, it is clear that the plaintiffs are\\nthe owners in respect of this ‘B’ Schedule property. However, the\\ndefendant/appellant contested this claim. Although the defendant/appellant\\nchallenged this claim of the plaintiffs in respect of the ‘B’ schedule property, he\\nhas failed to establish that he has acquired any valid title in respect of the said\\nproperty. In his evidence, the defendant/appellant clearly admitted that he had\\nno document of title to establish his claim over this property. It is the further\\ncase of the defendant/appellant that he acquired title in respect of the ‘B’\\nschedule property by way of adverse possession. However, from the concurrent\\nfindings of both the Courts below, it has been clearly established that this claim\\nof adverse possession was not established by the defendant/appellant. At the\\nsame time, the defendant/appellant claimed that he purchased this property\\nfrom the erstwhile zamindars. It appears that this claim of the\\ndefendant/appellant was rejected by the Court in an earlier suit and the deed\\nof the defendant/appellant in this respect was declared to be void. Of course, thelearned advocate for the defendant/appellant argued that an appeal is still\\npending in this respect, but nothing has been produced before this Court to\\nestablish this claim. Be that as it may, it appears that both the Courts decided\\nconcurrently that the defendant/appellant did not acquire any title in respect of\\nthe ‘B’ schedule property either by virtue of the purchase or by way of adverse\\npossession. It is pertinent to mention here that it is not permissible for the\\ndefendant/appellant to claim ownership by way of adverse possession when\\nactually his claim is based on the basis of a title deed which was declared void.\\nLearned advocate for the appellant argued that the learned Courts below\\nwere not justified in placing reliance upon the record of rights when in an earlier\\nsuit the validity of the said record of right was disputed and the defendant’s title\\nin respect of the 0.02 decimals of land of the suit property was declared by way\\nof adverse possession. However, both the Courts below rejected this contention\\nas raised by the appellant. I do not find any reason to interfere with the said\\nfinding of the Courts below. Simply because the Court in another suit declared\\nthe title of the defendant/appellant in respect of .02 decimals of land by way of\\nadverse possession, that does not mean that the Court disbelieved the entire\\nrecord of rights. The main question so far as this suit is concerned is whether\\nthe defendant has got right, title , interest in respect of the ‘B’ Schedule property\\nor not. I have already pointed out that both the Courts below concurrently\\ndecided that the defendants had failed to establish that he has acquired any title\\nover this ‘B’ schedule property. On the contrary, both the Courts have held thatthere are sufficient materials to hold that the plaintiffs/respondents were\\nsuccessful in establishing their title in respect of the ‘B’ schedule property and\\nconsequently a decree for declaration of title and permanent injunction in\\nrespect of the said property was passed. It is the settled position of law that the\\nconcurrent findings of fact, as arrived at by the Courts below, should not be\\ninterfered by the High Court while hearing a second appeal, unless there are\\nvalid reasons for that. I have already pointed out that both the Courts below\\ndiscussed the materials on record in details and thereafter came to such a\\nconclusion and as such I think that it is not permissible for this Court to\\ninterfere with the said concurrent findings of the Courts below.\\nLearned Advocate for the defendant/appellant argued that as the earlier\\nsuit over the same subject matter, was dismissed for default, and as there was\\nno prayer for restoration, so the filing of the subsequent suit i.e. the present suit,\\nis barred as per provisions of Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In\\nthis respect, he has drawn my attention that the earlier suit being Title Suit No.\\n19 of 1985 was dismissed for non-prosecution by the order No. 30 dated\\n21.7.1989. I have perused the said copy of the order wherefrom it appears that\\nthe said suit was dismissed for non-prosecution. According to the learned\\nadvocate for the appellant that since the said suit was dismissed as per\\nprovisions of Order 9 Rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Code, so a fresh suit on the\\nselfsame subject matter cannot be filed as per provisions of Order 9 Rule 9 of the\\nCivil Procedure Code. On the contrary, learned advocate for the respondentssubmitted that the suit was dismissed by the Court as per provisions of Order 9\\nRule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code and as such there is no bar for filing a fresh\\nsuit when no decree was drawn by virtue of the order dated 21.7.1989. So, it\\nappears that both the sides are making divergent claims in respect of the\\nmanner and the reason for which the earlier suit was dismissed on 21.7.1989.\\nBe that as it may, according to the learned advocate for the defendant/appellant,\\nas the earlier suit for the selfsame subject matter was dismissed, so the present\\nsuit which was filed by the plaintiffs for declaration and permanent injunction\\nin respect of the ‘B’ schedule property of Title Suit No. 260 of 1999, is not\\nmaintainable being barred by the principle of res judicata. The principle of res\\njudicata has been laid down under Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code.\\nSection 11 of Civil Procedure Code runs as follows :-\\n“No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in\\nissue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties,\\nor between the parties under whom they or any of them claimed, litigating under the same\\ntitle , in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has\\nbeen subsequently raised and has been heard and finally decided by such Court.”\\nSo it appears that in order to attract this provision it is to be established\\nthat in both the suits the subject matter and parties were same and the issue in\\nquestion was raised and heard by the Court and also finally decided by such\\nCourt. So far as these two suits are concerned, it appears that the parties of\\nthose suits were not same and the cause of action was also not similar. In the\\nearlier suit , there was only a prayer for permanent injunction whereas in thesubsequent suit in addition to the prayer for permanent injunction a prayer for\\ndeclaration of title was also made. If we look into the plaints of both the suits,\\nthen it will appear that cause of action of both the suits were also different.\\nAbove all, in the earlier suit the question which was involved in between the\\nparties were not at all heard or decided by the Court. As such, I am of opinion\\nthat the claim of the defendant/appellant that the present suit is barred as per\\nprovisions of res judicata cannot be accepted.\\nThat apart, although in the written statement , the defendant/appellant\\nactually raised this question, but no issue was framed in this respect by the\\nlearned Trial Court and the matter was never agitated before the said Court on\\nbehalf of the defendant/appellant. Again, if we look into the memorandum of\\nappeal, as filed before the learned First Appellate Court, then it will also appear\\nthat in it, no such plea was taken on behalf of the defendant/appellant before\\nthe said Appellate Court. As such, in my considered opinion, the\\ndefendant/appellant should not be permitted to raise this point for the first time\\nbefore this second appellate forum.\\nTherefore, from my above discussion, I am of opinion that both the Courts\\nbelow were perfectly justified in declaring the plaintiffs’ right, title and interest in\\nrespect of the suit property and also by allowing the prayer of the plaintiffs to\\nhave a decree for partition in respect of the suit property by metes and bounds.\\nThe Courts below were perfectly justified in declaring the plaintiffs’ title inrespect of the ‘B’ schedule property and also an order of permanent injunction\\nagainst the defendant/appellant. I do not find any reason whatsoever to interfere\\nwith the said concurrent findings of the Courts below and to my mind the\\npresent appeal being devoid of merit should be dismissed. All the questions of\\nlaw, as framed in this second appeal, are answered accordingly.\\nIn the result, both the appeals are dismissed on contest but without cost.\\nThe judgment and decree as passed by the learned Additional District\\nJudge, Fast Track Court-II, Alipore in Title Appeal No. 161 and 162 of 2004 is\\nconfirmed.\\nSend a copy of this judgment along with lower Court records to the Court\\nbelow at once for information and taking necessary action.\\nUrgent Xerox certified copy be handed over to the parties , if applied for.\\n(Sadhan Kumar Gupta, J. )(Later)\\nAfter the judgment pronounced, learned Advocate for the appellant prays\\nfor stay of operation of the judgment.\\nI have considered such submission. The prayer, as made by the learned\\nAdvocate for the appellant is rejected.\\n(Sadhan Kumar Gupta, J.)',\n",

During pendency of said suit while plaintiff was away\\nfrom her house in between 20.05.1999 and 27.05.1999, her daughter-in-law Soma\\nDutta forcefully entered into suit house by breaking lock and started to reside there\\nwith her parents being respondent Nos. 2 and 3. Plaintiff accordingly filed the\\npresent suit being Title Suit No.151 of 1999 praying for recovery of ‘khas’\\npossession along with declaration of title and other consequential reliefs after\\nwithdrawing the earlier suit.\\nRespondent /Defendant No.1 contested said suit by filing written statement\\ndenying material allegations of the plaint and contending inter alia that she was\\nmarried with plaintiff’s son on 20.02.1994 and started to reside in the suit premises\\nas her matrimonial home and that a female child was born out of their wedlock. She\\nwas subjected to torture by her husband and other in-laws, and she was driven away\\nfrom her matrimonial home along with her minor child. Her husband filed one\\ndivorce suit being Mat.

On the basis of the complaint a police case was initiated and her\\nhusband and other in-laws took her back in the matrimonial home. After few days\\nplaintiff / mother-in-law and her son left said matrimonial home of defendant No.1\\nwithout informing defendant No.1 and that defendant No.1 is not liable to be evicted\\nfrom suit premises as the same is her matrimonial home.\\nOn the basis of the pleadings of the parties learned Trial Court framed several\\nissues and after taking evidence of both sides decreed the suit against respondent\\nNo.1 on contest and ex partie against the rest.\\nDefendant No.1 / wife preferred an appeal being Title Appeal No.89 of 2005\\nin the District Court. Learned First Appellate Court came to the conclusion that the\\nsuit house was the matrimonial home of defendant No.1 / wife and that she could not\\nbe evicted therefrom, though her parents being defendant Nos. 2 and 3 had no right\\nto stay there and accordingly allowed the appeal in part.\\nThe plaintiff being aggrieved with said judgment of learned First Appellate\\nCourt has preferred this Second Appeal. At the time of admission of the Second\\nAppeal following substantial questions of law were framed on 01.11.2006.4\\n(a) Whether the learned Court of appeal below committed substantial error\\nof law in reversing the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial\\nJudge by totally overlooking the fact that the respondent had a right of\\nmaintenance and residence against her husband but not against her\\nmother-in-law so long her husband is alive and, as such, there was no\\njustification of reversing the judgment and decree passed in favour of\\nthe present appellant?\\n(b) Whether the learned court of appeal below committed substantial error\\nof law in overlooking the fact that a daughter-in-law cannot have any\\nright to stay in the property owned by her mother-in-law during the\\nlifetime of her husband and it is for the husband to maintain her?\\nDuring argument, at the prayer of learned advocates of both sides the\\nfollowing additional substantial question of law was framed :-\\n(c) Whether learned Court of appeal below committed substantial error of\\nlaw in considering the suit house as matrimonial home of respondent /\\ndefendant /daughter-in-law though said property stood in the name of\\nthe appellant /plaintiff / mother-in-law.5\\nThe short point of law involved in this case is whether the daughter-in-law has\\na right of residence in the premises standing in her mother-in-law’s name claiming\\nthe same to be her matrimonial home though her husband is alive.\\nFrom the materials of Lower Court record as well as from the submissions of\\nlearned advocates of both sides the following facts were found to be admitted:\\n(1) Respondent No.1 was married with the appellant’s son Asit Dutta on 20.02.94.\\n(2) After marriage housewife Soma Dutta started to reside in the suit house along\\nwith her husband and other in-laws.\\n(3) Suit house stood in the name of appellant mother-in-law, Maya Dutta.\\n(4) A female child was born out of their wedlock of Soma and Asit.\\n(5) While Soma and her child came to her father’s place and were staying there,\\nshe received a summon of divorce filed by her husband Asit Dutta.\\n(6) Soma lodged an F.I.R. against her husband and other in-laws including\\nmother-in-law alleging torture etc. resulting initiation of a specific police case.\\n(7) Mother-in-law Maya Dutta initially filed one Title Suit being No.124 of 1997\\nin the Court of learned Munsif, 3rd Court, Burdwan praying for declaration of6\\nher title in the property and other consequential reliefs alleging that daughter-\\nin-law Soma Dutta was trying to deny her title in the property.\\n(8) Presently daughter-in-law Soma Dutta is staying in the suit house along with\\nher parents and appellant mother-in-law, Maya Dutta and her son, Asit Dutta\\nare residing elsewhere.\\n(9) Appellant mother-in-law, Maya Dutta alleged that during their temporary\\nabsence from said house in between 20.05.99 and 27.05.99, daughter-in-law\\nSoma Dutta along with her parents forcibly entered into suit house after\\nbreaking lock, and started to reside there and accordingly she withdrew her\\nearlier suit being Title Suit No.124 of 97 and filed the present suit being Title\\nSuit No.151 of 99 praying for declaration of title, recovery of ‘Khas’\\npossession and other consequential reliefs.\\n(10) Respondent wife Soma Dutta, on the other hand, took the plea that after filing\\nof her complaint at P.S., she was brought back to her matrimonial home i.e.,\\nsuit house by her husband and mother-in-law, and that after keeping her there\\nwith her minor child they left the house for unknown destination.\\nMr. Sadananda Ganguli, learned advocate for the appellant, has submitted that\\nlearned Lower Appellate Court gave undue stress on one line of cross-examination of\\nappellant P.W.1 wherein she stated in her cross-examination that suit property7\\nbelonged to her husband and that at the time of negotiation of marriage P.W.1 stated\\nthat after marriage her daugher-in-law Soma Dutta would reside in her house along\\nwith her husband as her matrimonial home.\\nAccording to Mr. Ganguli evidence of witness should be read as a whole and\\nnot by taking one sentence from here and one from there. According to him, Hindu\\nhousewives often describe the property owned by her as the property of her husband\\nbut that does not change the ownership of the property. It is his further submission\\nthat there was neither any pleading in the W.S. nor any evidence that suit property\\nwas the property of appellant’s husband but was purchased in the name of appellant\\nmother-in-law. In absence of such averment in pleadings (W.S.) and also evidence to\\nthat effect, there was no scope of treating the suit property as the property of\\nappellant’s husband or that on the death of appellant’s husband his legal heirs\\nincluding his son, the husband of respondent housewife Soma Dutta, got any share in\\nthe property, or that on that score said property became matrimonial home of\\nhousewife Soma Dutta. According to him, learned Lower Appellate Court came to a\\nwrong finding by assessing the evidence from wrong perspective. In this connection,\\nhe has referred a case law reported in AIR 2007 SC page 1118 (S.R. Batra and\\nanother v. Smt. Taruna Batra). In the referred case law a question arose as to\\nwhether a daughter-in-law can forcibly occupy the premises of her mother-in-law8\\nclaiming it to be her matrimonial house under Sections 17 and 18 of the Protection of\\nWomen from Domestic Violence Act (43 of 2005). Hon’ble Apex Court referred to\\nSection 2 (s) of said Act of 2005 wherein “shared household” was defined as follows:\\n“ ‘ shared household’ means a household where the person aggrieved lives or\\nat any stage has lived in a domestic relationship either singly or along with the\\nrespondent and includes such a household whether owned or tenanted either jointly\\nby the aggrieved person and the respondent, or owned or tenanted by either of them\\nin respect of which either the aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or\\nsingly have any right, title, interest or equity and includes such a household which\\nmay belong to the joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of\\nwhether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title or interest in the\\nshared household.”\\nIn spite of said broad definition of “shared household” Hon’ble Apex Court\\nheld that as regards Section 17(1) of said Act of 2005, the wife was only entitled to\\nclaim a right of residence in the shared household, and a shared household would\\nonly mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house\\nwhich belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member and that the9\\nhouse belonging to a mother-in-law cannot be said to be a shared household or\\nmatrimonial house of the daughter-in-law.\\nThe aforesaid judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court was followed by the same\\nCourt in the subsequent judgment reported in (2008) 4 SCC page 649 wherein it was\\nheld that under Sections 17 and 20 of the Act of 2005 wife has not only right of\\nmaintenance but also a right of residence but said right of residence extends only to\\nthe property or joint properties in which husband has a share.\\nMr. P. Chatturvedi, learned advocate for the respondent, on the other hand, has\\nsubmitted that appellant mother-in-law herself admitted in her cross-examination that\\nthe suit property belonged to her husband and that at the time of negotiation of\\nmarriage she assured that suit property will be the matrimonial home of her daughter-\\nin-law and that she cannot be permitted to deny those admissions.\\nI find little merit in the aforesaid submissions of Mr. Chatturvedi. It was\\nnobody’s case that suit property belonged to the husband of the appellant mother-in-\\nlaw or that same was purchased in ‘benam’ of the appellant mother-in-law. In\\nabsence of said pleadings, one stray statement of appellant (P.W.1) in her cross-10\\nexamination cannot change the ownership of the property from mother-in-law to the\\nfather-in-law.\\nIn Indian society after marriage a housewife usually resides in her in-laws\\nhouse when the husband has no house of his own, and the same is usually treated as\\nher matrimonial home. In England the rights of the spouses to the matrimonial home\\nare governed by the Matrimonial Homes Act, 1967 but, no such right exists in India.\\nIn this connection, learned Advocate Mr. P. Chatturvedi has referred a case\\nlaw reported in 1925 Madras page 757 ( Sri Raja Bommadevara Raja Lakshmi Devi\\nAmma Garu v. Sri Raja B. Naganna Naidu Bahadur Zamindar Garu and another) to\\nimpress upon this Court that the wives of coparcenors are members of the joint\\nfamily, though they may not be entitled to share in the estate of the family or to\\nenforce any partition though the Hindu Law imposes an obligation on the Hindu\\nhusband to support his wife without any reference to any property or share possessed\\nby him, yet when the joint family possessed of property, a claim by a wife against her\\nhusband need not be regarded merely as a suit for enforcement of any personal\\nobligation, but may well be regarded as a suit against the family itself, represented by\\nher husband, through whom alone so long as he is alive she has to obtain the relief.11\\nUnfortunately, the above case law has no relevance at this stage after\\npromulgation of various statutes namely Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act,\\n1956, Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 etc. wherein extent\\nof rights of a Hindu housewife relating to maintenance and / or residence were\\nprescribed.\\nMr. P. Chatturvedi learned advocate for the respondent has also referred case\\nlaws reported in AIR 1991 Calcutta page 399 (Basudeb Dey Sarkar v. Chhaya Dey\\nSarkar) and AIR 1958 Andhra Pradesh page 396 (Chandramma v. Venkatareddy)\\nwherefrom it appears that wife has right of maintenance as well as residence against\\nher husband, and the property may be personal property or joint property of the\\nhusband. But nowhere it was stated that housewife has any claim of residence as a\\nmatter of right in the property belonging to her mother-in-law.\\nIn the case in hand, admittedly, respondent husband is very much alive and as\\nper respondent’s submission he is a Government servant. As such respondent has\\nevery right to claim maintenance as well as residence against her husband.\\nLearned Advocate for the respondent has submitted that by this time the\\ndivorce suit filed by the husband has been dismissed. Learned advocate for the12\\nappellant, however, expressed his ignorance about the same. Be that as it may, it did\\nnot improve the right of respondent housewife in any way so far as it relates to the\\nsuit property being the property of her mother-in-law, appellant.\\nLearned advocate for the respondent has further submitted that the suit was\\nbad for non-joinder of necessary party as the minor daughter of the respondent wife\\nwho was also residing in the suit house along with her mother, was not made a party\\nin the suit for declaration and eviction.\\nLearned advocate for the appellant has referred to the judgment of learned\\nTrial Court wherein the issue of “non-joinder of necessary party” was disposed of in\\nfavour of the plaintiff for being not pressed by the defendant housewife. According\\nto him, at this stage there is no scope of agitating the issue.\\nAdmittedly, the issue of non-joinder of necessary party has to be taken at the\\nearliest opportunity and it cannot be taken belatedly, not to speak, in the forum of\\nSecond Appeal. Apart from that, the minor daughter of respondent wife is also grand\\ndaughter of appellant mother-in-law, and she may not have any objection for staying\\nof said grand daughter in her house along with her.13\\nFor deciding the main point in issue it is not at all required to decide how the\\nrespondent wife came into possession of the suit house in 1999, viz, whether she\\nalong with her parents forcibly entered into the suit house after breaking open\\npadlock, during temporary absence therefrom by the appellant and her son, as alleged\\nby the appellant, or she was taken to suit house by her husband and mother-in-law,\\nafter filing of the criminal case by her as alleged by the respondent. However, it\\nprima facie seems to be improbable that the husband and mother-in-law will invite\\nrespondent housewife in the suit house when the divorce suit filed by the husband as\\nwell as criminal case filed by the wife against husband and other in-laws including\\nmother-in-law, and a Title Suit filed by mother-in-law against daughter-in-law are\\nstill pending.\\nBe that as it may, I have no hesitation to find and hold that though respondent\\nhousewife had a right of maintenance and residence against her husband but she had\\nno such right against her mother-in-law. Again the daughter-in-law cannot have a\\nright of residence in the property of mother-in-law claiming it to be her matrimonial\\nhome though after marriage she used to reside there along with her husband and\\nother in-laws. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that learned Lower Court of Appeal\\ncommitted substantial error of law in reversing the judgment and decree passed by\\nlearned Trial Court and that impugned judgment and decree are not sustainable in14\\nlaw. As a result, the appeal stands allowed. Impugned judgment and decree dated\\n24th April, 2006 passed by learned Additional District Judge, 3rd Court, Burdwan in\\nTitle Appeal No.89 of 2005 is hereby set aside by reviving the judgment and decree\\ndated 1st of October, 2005 passed by learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Burdwan\\nin Title Suit No.151 of 1999.\\nOffice is directed to send down Lower Court records along with a copy of this\\njudgment to the learned Lower Court expeditiously.\\nUrgent xerox certified copy of the judgment be supplied to the learned\\nCounsels of the party / parties, if applied for.\\n(Tarun Kumar Gupta, J.)',\n",

Tapati Rakshit which was re-numbered as Title Suit No. 72 of 1997 and\\nsuch suit shall hereinafter be described as the first suit. The Title Suit No. 9 of\\n1995 which was re-numbered as Title Suit No. 103 of 1996 was filed by the said\\nTapati Rakshit against the said Bhusan Kumar Das. This suit shall be\\nhereinafter be referred to as the second suit. In the first suit Bhusan prayed for\\na decree for declaration that he is a premises tenant in the suit premises under\\nthe said Tapati Rakshit and that he is not a licensee in the suit premises and\\nthat he has got every right to possess the suit premises and to run his business\\ntherein until he is evicted by any decree of eviction under the West Bengal\\nPremises Tenancy Act. He also prayed for an order of permanent injunction\\nrestraining the said Tapati Rakshit from disturbing his peaceful possession in thesuit premises and the smooth running of the business. The case of the appellant\\nBhusan Kumar Das in the said suit was inter alia to the effect that the suit\\npremises previously belonged to one Subodh Kumar Rakshit who died leaving his\\nsons, daughters and wife and that Tapati Rakshit is a daughter of the said\\nSubodh Kumar Rakshit; that the said Subodh Kumar Rakshit had let out the\\nsuit premises to one Tilak Das who used to run a business in the name and style\\nof Sree Hanuman Stores; that the said Tilak Das died on 03.03.1984 leaving\\nbehind his wife and sons which included one Shree Mahesh Prosad Das; that\\nsubsequently by a mutual arrangement among such heirs Mahesh Prosad Das\\nonly was authorised to look after the business and to become the sole tenant of\\nthe suit premises; accordingly, Mahesh Prosad Das alone used to run the\\nbusiness and paid rent in his own name and the name of the business was\\nchanged to Sree Ram Stores; on the death of Subodh Kumar Rakshit his heirs\\nthrough Urmila Rakshit (mother of Tapati Rakshit) used to collect rent from the\\nsaid Mahesh Prosad Das; that Mahesh Prosad Das found it difficult to run the\\nbusiness and made an arrangement with the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das to\\nrun the business in the suit premises for which Mahesh Prosad Das demanded\\nand realised huge amount from the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das and a\\ncondition was imposed that all liabilities will be shouldered by the said Bhusan\\nKumar Das. According to the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das, in January, 1986 a\\nnegotiation was held in presence of Urmila Rakshit and her sons and daughters\\nwhen the said Mahesh Prosad Das and the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das were\\nalso present and all the persons accepted that the appellant Bhusan Kumar Dasshall be treated to be the tenant but Urmila Rakshit imposed the conditions that\\neven though rent would be paid by the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das but the\\nreceipts would be granted in the name of Mahesh Prosad Das and that an\\nagreement dated 08.01.1986 was entered into by the appellant Bhusan Kumar\\nDas and the said Mahesh Prosad Das and since then the appellant Bhusan\\nKumar Das is running the said business in the name and style of Sree Ram\\nStores. It was the further case of the appellant i.e. Bhusan Kumar Das that in\\nMarch, 1993 the properties inherited by the said Tapati Rakshit and other heirs\\nand legal representatives of late Subodh Kumar Rakshit were partitioned and the\\nsaid premises was allotted to Tapati Rakshit who used to realize rent from the\\nappellant Subodh Kumar Das by granting receipt in the name of Mahesh Prosad\\nDas. It was the further case of the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das that on several\\noccasions he requested the said Tapati Rakshit to grant receipts in his name\\ninstead of Mahesh Prosad Das who declared that he had no objection if rent\\nreceipt is issued in the name of Bhusan Kumar Das in respect of the suit\\npremises and in such context the defendant, her mother and brothers obtained\\nmany signatures of Mahesh Prosad Das on blank papers/blank stamp papers on\\nassurance that such papers/documents of tenancy would prepared later on but\\non several pleas the matter was delayed and ultimately the appellant Bhusan\\nKumar Das received a notice on 22.08.1994 sent by the Learned Advocate of\\nTapati Rakshit in which the said Bhusan Kumar Das was described as a licensee\\nand he was asked to quit and vacate the suit premises. Hence the said first suit\\nwas filed by the said Bhusan Kumar Das.The said Tapati Rakshit filed the second suit against the said Bhusan\\nKumar Das praying for decree of eviction of the said Bhusan Kumar Das from the\\nsuit premises and for mesne profits. The case of the said Tapati Rakshit in the\\nplaint was that the suit premises along with other properties belonged to her\\nfather late Subodh Kumar Rakshit and on her father’s death her mother, her\\nbrothers and her sister and herself inherited the properties of late Subodh Kumar\\nRakshit including the suit premises and subsequently there was a deed of\\npartition dated 26.03.1993 whereby the said Tapati Rakshit was allotted the suit\\npremises and other properties and the said Tapati Rakshit became the exclusive\\nowner of such properties. According to the said Tapati Rakshit, the suit property\\nwas let out to Shree Mahesh Prosad Das who became a tenant under the said\\nTapati Rakshit and ultimately the said Mahesh Prosad Das had surrendered the\\ntenancy and delivered possession of the suit property in favour of the said Tapati\\nRakshit; the said Bhusan Kumar Das was an employee of the said Mahesh\\nProsad Das and after surrender of the suit property by the said Mahesh Prosad\\nDas, the said Bhusan Kumar Das disclosed that he had purchased some\\nbusiness articles from the said Mahesh Prosad Das and that he required some\\ntime for removal of such articles and thus he prayed for granting license and/or\\npermission from the said Tapati Rakshit, and accordingly, such license was\\ngranted to the said Bhusan Kumar Das for a short period to occupy the suit\\nproperty and the said Bhusan Kumar Das also promised to deliver possession of\\nthe suit property within a short period of time and that since the said BhusanKumar Das was only causing delay in delivering back the suit property to the\\nsaid Tapati Rakshit on some pretext or the other, the said Tapati Rakshit revoked\\nthe said license by an advocate’s letter in the year 1994; that the said Bhusan\\nKumar Das received the said notice but instead of delivering the possession of\\nthe suit premises to the said Tapati Rakshit, filed the said first suit claiming a\\ntenancy right in the suit premises. Hence, the said second suit was filed by the\\nsaid Tapati Rakshit.\\nBoth the suits were contested by the respective defendants by filing written\\nstatement and the case of the defendant in the first suit is similar to the case of\\nthe plaintiff in the second suit and the case of the plaintiff in the first suit is\\nsimilar to the case of the defendant in the second suit. It appears from the\\nmaterials on record that by virtue of the transfer of suit property the respondent\\nSanjay Kumar Dutta stepped into the shoes of Smt. Tapati Rakshit and he was\\nbrought on record in the two suits.\\nThe two suits were heard analogously and by a common judgement dated\\n29th June, 2007 the first suit was dismissed and the second suit was decreed on\\ncontest and the respondent Sanjay Kumar Dutta was granted a decree of eviction\\nof the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das from the suit premises and the appellant\\nBhusan Kumar Das was directed to quit and vacate the suit premises within 30\\ndays of the date of the judgement and deliver khas possession of the suit\\npremises to the said Sanjay Kumar Dutta failing which liberty was given to the\\nSanjay Kumar Dutta to file execution case for execution of the decree.That challenging such judgement and decrees dated 29th June, 2007 the\\nappellant Bhusan Kumar Das preferred Title Appeal No. 140 of 2007 and Title\\nAppeal No. 141 of 2007 which were also heard analogously by the Learned Lower\\nAppellate Court and by a common judgement dated 8th July, 2008 dismissed\\nboth the appeals.\\nChallenging the judgement and decrees dated 8th July, 2008 passed in\\nboth the aforesaid appeals being Title Appeal No. 140 of 2007 and Title Appeal\\nNo. 141 of 2007 the appellant Bhusan Kumar Das has filed the present two\\nSecond Appeals being S.A. No. 626 of 2008 and S.A. No. 627 of 2008.\\nIt appears from records that the present Second Appeals were admitted on\\nthe following two grounds :-\\n(a) Whether the learned Courts below committed substantial error of law\\nin holding that there existed no relationship of the landlord and the tenant\\nbetween the parties by totally misreading Exhibit 9 admittedly executed by\\nTapati in favour of the appellant;\\n(b) Whether the learned Courts below committed substantial error of law\\nin holding that even after execution of Exhibit 9, there is necessity of\\nfurther showing payment of rent by grant of rent receipt by overlooking the\\nfact that in Exhibit 9 itself, creation of tenancy in favour of the appellant\\nhas been admitted and thus, so long that tenancy is not terminated inaccordance with law, the relationship between the landlord and the tenant\\ncontinues;\\nIt appears from the judgement of the Learned Trial Court that the Learned\\nTrial Court found that admittedly Mahesh Prosad Das was the previous tenant.\\nIt further appears from a written agreement allegedly executed by Tapati Rakshit\\non 02.05.1994 and marked as Ext. 9, that Bhusan Kumar Das took possession of\\nthe suit premises from the previous tenant and proposed to possess the suit\\nproperty on rent. The Learned Trial Court observed that such document is a\\ncontroversial one and even though it was marked as Ext. 9, the respondent\\n(Sanjoy Kumar Dutta) filed an application for expunging the said document but\\nthe said application was rejected by order dated 29.08.2005. That challenging\\nsuch order the respondent filed a revisional application in this court being C.O.\\nNo. 3413 of 2005 and this court had directed the Learned Trial Court to consider\\nthe relevancy and evidentiary value of the said document. It further appears\\nfrom a perusal of the judgement of the Learned Trial Court that the said\\ndocument Ext. 9 was not mentioned even in the plaint filed by the present\\nappellant nor it was mentioned by the present appellant in the written statement\\nfiled in the suit brought by the said Tapati Rakshit and as such the appellant\\nfiled an application for amendment of the plaint in the first suit but the said\\napplication was rejected by the Learned Trial Court by an order dated 17.05.2005\\nand the appellant filed a Civil Revisional Application being C.O. No. 2097 of 2005\\nin this court which was rejected by this court. The Learned Trial Court found\\nthat there is practically very little evidentiary value of Ext. 9. The Learned TrialCourt, however, found that if for a moment all the contents of Ext. 9 are taken to\\nbe correct, it gives a devastating blow to the appellant’s case because the\\ndocument states that the date of induction was 1st May, 1994 as against the\\nclaim of the appellant that the tenancy commenced since 1986. The Learned\\nTrial Court found that having regard to the contradictory statements, the\\nLearned Trial Court totally disbelieves the allegation of induction of the appellant.\\nThe Learned Trial Court further found that the appellant failed to prove his claim\\nof tenancy and failed to prove the allegation of induction as a tenant and the\\nappellant also failed to prove the alleged tenancy by not being able to produce\\nany rent receipt in his favour. The Learned Trial Court found that the appellant\\nwas a licensee and not a tenant. The Learned Trial Court found that the first suit\\nshould be dismissed and the second suit should be decreed and, accordingly, it\\ngranted a decree of eviction of the appellant from the suit premises in favour of\\nthe respondent.\\nThe Learned Appellate Court affirmed the judgement and decrees of the\\nLearned Trial Court by holding inter alia that the appellant failed to prove any\\ndocument to show that he paid rent during the period from 1986 to 1994. The\\nLearned Appellate Court also found that the title of Tapati Rakshit as well as the\\npresent respondent has neither been denied nor it can be denied. With regard to\\nExt. 9 the Learned Lower Appellate Court observed that the said document does\\nnot explain as to what happened during the period 1986 to 1994.The Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant Bhusan\\nKumar Das relied upon Ext. 9 in support of his submission that a tenancy was\\ncreated in favour of the appellant and in view of the acceptance of the Ext. 9 the\\nquestion of payment of rent or non-payment of rent becomes immaterial and\\nmere non-payment of rent cannot obliterate the tenancy. The said Learned\\nSenior Counsel submitted that since there is an admission in a document, in this\\ncase Ext. 9, unless there is a proper explanation regarding such admission, such\\nadmission becomes conclusive. His further submission was that it will appear\\nfrom the agreement that the previous tenant (Mahesh Prasad Das) surrendered\\nthe tenancy in favour of Tapati Rakshit and thereafter the tenancy agreement\\nbetween the said Tapati Rakshit and the appellant was executed.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant cited a decision reported at\\n38 C.W.N. 861 (Nanilal Das - vs. - Nutbehari Das and ors.) in support of his\\nsubmission that even though the burden of proving a fact may be on a certain\\nparty, an admission of such fact is the best evidence against the party making it\\nand that there shall be a presumption that such admission is true unless it is\\nshown that it is untrue or it was made under certain circumstances which do not\\nmake it binding.\\nThe said Learned Counsel cited another decision reported in A.I.R. 1960\\nSupreme Court 100 (Narayan Bhagwantrao Gosavi Balajiwale - vs. - Gopal\\nVinayak Gosavi and others) and relied upon with the observation of the Hon’bleSupreme Court in paragraph 11 of the said reports to the effect that an\\nadmission is the best evidence that an opposing party can rely upon, and though\\nnot conclusive, is decisive of the matter, unless successfully withdrawn or proved\\nerroneous.\\nThe said Learned Counsel also relied upon a decision reported at A.I.R.\\n1981 Supreme Court 2085 (Ramji Dayawala & sons (P) Ltd. - vs. - Invest\\nImport) and referred to paragraph 17 of the said reports wherein the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court was pleased to observe that an admission, unless explained,\\nfurnishes the best evidence. According to the said Learned Senior Counsel, Ext.\\n9 was not explained either by the said Tapati Rakshit or by the respondent.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant cited a decision reported at\\nA.I.R. 1965 Supreme Court 610 (Mrs. M. N. Clubwala and another - vs. -\\nFida Hussain Saheb and others) in support of his submission that to find out\\nwhether an agreement is an agreement of tenancy or merely a licence the court\\nshould take into consideration the intention of the parties and such intention has\\nto be ascertained on a consideration of all the relevant provisions in the\\nagreement. His submission was that the Ext. 9 proves that a tenancy agreement\\nwas created in between the appellant and the said Tapati Rakshit and the case of\\nthe appellant is based on the said Ext. 9.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent\\nsubmitted that the allegation regarding Ext. 9 was not pleaded either in theplaint of the first suit or in the written statement of the second suit and the\\nappellant tried to amend his pleadings in the two suits but on both the occasions\\nthe appellant’s application for amendment of his pleadings were rejected by the\\nLearned Trial Court. Two Civil Revision cases were filed by the appellant being\\nC.O. No. 2097 of 2005 and C.O. No. 4505 of 2006. The said Learned Senior\\nCounsel relied upon the order dated 30th June, 2005 passed by an Hon’ble Single\\nJudge of this court in C.O. No. 2097 of 2005. The said C.O. No. 2097 of 2005\\nwas filed against an order of the Learned Trial Court whereby the appellant’s\\napplication for amendment of his written statement in the second suit was\\nrejected. His Lordship on perusal of the application for amendment of the\\nwritten statement and the original written statement, was pleased to observe that\\nit appears that the allegations are concocted for the purpose of filing the\\napplication for amendment of the written statement of Bhusan Kumar Das. His\\nLordship was further pleased to observe that the said Bhusan Kumar Das never\\nwhispered about the existence of any document acknowledging his tenancy by\\nthe erstwhile landlady and in the written statement also the said Bhusan Kumar\\nDas never alleged about the existence of any such document and the application\\nfor amendment of the written statement was filed to drag the suit. His Lordship\\nwas pleased to dismiss the revisional application. In C.O. No. 4505 of 2006 this\\ncourt by order dated 23.04.2007 took note of the earlier order dated 30.06.2005\\nand observed that subsequent to the filing of the document the appellant herein\\nagain wanted to amend his pleadings but this time his plaint in the first suit but\\nthe aim for amendment of pleadings remained the same. The Learned TrialCourt dismissed the application for amendment of the plaint of the appellant and\\nagainst such order passed by the Learned Trial Court the said C.O. No. 4505 of\\n2006 was filed by the appellant. This court by the said order dated 23.04.2007\\nalso dismissed the said C.O. No. 4505 of 2006. Thus upto this court the\\nappellant’s applications for amendment of his pleadings stood rejected. The\\nLearned Senior Counsel for the respondent further submitted that the document\\nbeing Ext. 9 was marked as on Exhibit in spite of objection being raised on behalf\\nof the respondent.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent further submitted that the\\nrespondent had filed an application for expunging the said Ext. 9 but the said\\napplication was dismissed by an order dated 29.08.2005 passed by the Learned\\nTrial Court. That challenging such order dated 29.08.2005 the respondent filed a\\nCivil Revision case in this court being C.O. No. 3413 of 2005 and an Hon’ble\\nSingle Judge of this court by an order dated 07.04.2006 was pleased to observe\\nthat when a document is admitted in evidence, it does not mean that the\\ncontents thereof are sacrosanct, particularly, when such document was admitted\\nwith objection. His Lordship was pleased to dispose of the revisional application\\nwith the direction on the Learned Trial Judge to consider the relevance and the\\nevidentiary value of the said alleged agreement being Ext. 9 at the time of final\\nhearing of the suit. The Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent submitted\\nthat both the Learned Courts below found that Ext. 9 did not have any\\nfoundation in the pleadings of the appellant and since there were no pleadings\\nwith regard to Ext. 9, the said Ext. 9 cannot be relied upon, particularly, whenthe efforts on the part of the appellant to amend his pleadings were unsuccessful\\nupto this court.\\nThe said Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent further submitted that\\nan application was made by the respondent for appointment of an expert to verify\\nthe signatures of Tapati Rakshit purportedly appearing on the said Ext. 9 which\\nis a fraudulent document. The Learned Trial Court by order dated 01.07.2006\\ndismissed the said application of the respondent on the ground that the said Ext.\\n9 is not supported by any pleadings and as such it is meaningless and cannot be\\nconsidered as an evidence. The Learned Trial Court also observed that a\\ndocument, even if, inadvertently exhibited in evidence, does not prove the fact\\nstated in such document when it is not supported by pleadings of the party\\nconcerned who presents such document. Accordingly, the Learned Trial Court\\nheld that there is no justification to refer the matter to any expert for verification\\nof the signatures of the said Tapati Rakshit since such exercise would only result\\nin wastage of time.\\nAccording to the said Learned Senior Counsel, Ext. 9 cannot be said to be\\nan admitted document in the aforesaid circumstances. His further submission\\nwas that if such document (Ext. 9) cannot be treated as an admitted document\\nthe arguments made by the Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant fails.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent cited a decision reported at\\nAIR 1980 Supreme Court 1109 (Nirod Baran Banerjee - vs. - Dy.Commissioner of Hazaribagh) and referred to paragraph 6 of the said reports\\nwherein it has been observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that no evidence can\\nbe looked into by the court for which there is no foundation in the pleadings.\\nHe referred to another judgement reported at A.I.R. 1996 Supreme Court\\n112 (Abubakar Abdul Inamdar (dead) by LRs. and others - vs. - Harun Abdul\\nInamdar and others) and referred to paragraph 5 of the said reports wherein the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court was pleased to observe inter alia that no amount of proof\\ncan substitute pleadings which are the foundation of the claim of a litigating\\nparty. The Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent also submitted that the\\nobservations made by the Learned Trial Court in the aforesaid order dated\\n01.07.2006 have not been challenged by the appellant in the present appeal.\\nAccording to the said Learned Senior Counsel, the appellant cannot rely upon\\nExt. 9.\\nHe cited a decision reported at A.I.R. 1960 Supreme Court 941 in\\nsupport of his contention that since the appellant has not challenged such\\nobservations of the Trial Court in the Trial Court’s order dated 01.07.2006, in\\nspite of having opportunity to challenge such observations, the appellant cannot\\nat this stage in the second appeal take exception to the said observations of the\\nLearned Trial Court. According to the said Learned Senior Counsel for the\\nrespondent, the reported cases cited by the Learned Senior Counsel for the\\nappellant has no manner of application in the facts and circumstances of thepresent case since there was no admission on the part of the respondent and/or\\nthe said Tapati Rakshit with regard to Ext. 9.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent cited a decision reported at\\nA.I.R. 1970 Supreme Court 1 (Shankar Ramchandra Abhyankar - vs. -\\nKrishnaji Dattatraya Bapat) and referred to paragraph 6 and 8 of the said\\nreports. Paragraph 6 and 8 of the said reports are quoted below :-\\n“6. Now when the aid of the High Court is invoked on the revisional side\\nit is done because it is a superior Court and it can interfere for the purpose\\nof rectifying the error of the Court below. Section 115 of the Code of Civil\\nProcedure circumscribes the limits of that jurisdiction but the jurisdiction\\nwhich is being exercised is a part of the general appellate jurisdiction of the\\nHigh Court as a superior Court. It is only one of the modes of exercising\\npower conferred by\\nthe Statute; basically and fundamentally it is the appellate jurisdiction of\\nthe High Court which is being invoked and exercised in a wider and larger\\nsense. We do not therefore, consider that the principle of merger of orders\\nof inferior Courts in those of superior Courts would be affected or would\\nbecome inapplicable by making a distinction between a petition for revision\\nand an appeal.\\n8. Even on the assumption that the order of the appellate Court had\\nnot merged in the order of the single judge who had disposed of the\\nrevision petition we are of the view that a writ petition ought not to have\\nbeen entertained by the High Court when the respondent had already\\nchosen the remedy under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If\\nthere are two modes of invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court and one\\nof those modes has been chosen and exhausted it would not be a proper\\nand sound exercise of discretion to grant relief in the other set ofproceedings in respect of the same order of the Subordinate Court. The\\nrefusal to grant relief in such circumstances would be in consonance with\\nthe anxiety of the Court to prevent abuse of process as also to respect and\\naccord finality to its own decisions.”\\nIt will appear from the said reports that the Hon’ble Supreme Court was\\npleased to observe to the effect that if a revisional application is filed before the\\nHigh Court, the High Court, being a superior Court, can interfere for the\\npurposes of rectifying the error of the court below and the jurisdiction which the\\nHigh Court exercises under Section 115 CPC is a part of the appellate\\njurisdiction of the High Court as a superior Court. The said Learned Senior\\nCounsel submitted that since on earlier occasions this court had affirmed the\\norder of rejection of the appellant’s applications for amendment of his pleadings,\\nthis court, in second appeal, cannot pass an order which may have an adverse\\neffect on the earlier orders passed by this court in the revisional jurisdiction.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that\\nthe reported decisions AIR 1960 Supreme Court 100 and AIR 1981 Supreme\\nCourt 2085 cited by the Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant have no\\napplication in the facts and circumstances of the present case since the said\\ncases did not involve the question as to what would be the evidentiary value of\\nthe document which does not have its foundation in the pleadings. He further\\nsubmitted that in the instant case there is no admission on the part of the\\nrespondent and/or the said Tapati Rakshit with regard to Ext. 9 and as such the\\nsaid reported decisions cannot be of any assistance to the appellant. It is truethat admission, unless explained, furnishes the best evidence but such principle\\ncannot be applied to the facts and circumstances of the present case where there\\nhas been no admission at all on the part of the respondent and/or the said\\nTapati Rakshit with regard to the Ext. 9.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted that since Tapati\\nRakshit was not examined adverse inference should be drawn against the\\nrespondent and this court should also take into consideration the fact that there\\nis no finding to the effect that Ext. 9 has not been signed by Tapati Rakshit. The\\nsaid Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that even if the appellant’s effort\\nto amend his pleadings failed it does not matter since Ext. 9 is a only piece of\\nevidence and as such it need not be pleaded. He also submitted that the\\nrejection of the appellant’s application for amendment of pleadings for\\nintroducing Ext. 9 cannot prevent this court in second appeal to reconsider the\\nmatter.\\nHe cited the judgement reported at (2000) 1 Supreme Court Cases 434\\n(Ishwar Dass Jain (Dead) through LRs. - vs. - Sohan Lal (Dead) By LRs.) and\\nreferred to paragraph 21 of the said reports wherefrom it appears that the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court had observed that the plaintiff’s plea (in the said reported\\ncase) against the admissibility of certain Exhibits in the trial court was rejected\\nby the said court and a revision under Section 115 CPC was filed by the plaintiff\\nin the High Court but the High Court dismissed the revisional case since that\\nthere was no case decided within the meaning of the words “case decided” inSection 115 CPC. The plaintiff in the said reported case questioned the\\nadmissibility of the said Exhibits in the first appeal. In such circumstances, the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court was pleased to observe that it was permissible for the\\nsaid plaintiff to raise the said question in the first appeal in view of Section 105\\nCPC.\\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant also referred to paragraph 16\\nof the decision reported at A.I.R. 1960 Supreme Court 941 (Satyadhyan Ghosal\\nand others - vs. - Smt. Deorajin Debi and another) wherefrom it appears that\\nthe Hon’ble Supreme Court was pleased to observe that an interlocutory order\\nwhich had not been appealed from either because no appeal lay or even though\\nan appeal lay an appeal was not taken could be challenged in an appeal from the\\nfinal decree or order. The said Learned Senior Counsel also referred to Section\\n105 CPC.\\nHaving heard the Learned Senior Counsels for the respective parties and\\nhaving considered their respective submissions and the facts of the case and also\\nthe materials on record this court is of the view that the appellant has placed his\\nentire case upon Ext. 9. From the order of admission of this appeal it will also\\nappear that the present appeal was admitted on the basis of the existence of Ext.\\n9 on records. The decisions cited by the Learned Senior Counsel for the\\nappellant on the point of admission are based on the fact that there has to be a\\nvalid admission on record and that such admission can be taken into\\nconsideration in accordance with law.Some of the decisions cited by the Learned Senior Counsel for the\\nappellant on the point of admission are based on the fact that there were valid\\nadmissions on record but in the instant case Ext. 9 cannot be said to be an\\nadmitted document. It will appear from the facts of the present case that the\\nrespondent had applied for the appointment of an expert for verification of the\\nsignatures of Tapati Rakshit purportedly appearing on the document being Ext.\\n9. The Learned Trial Court dismissed such application on the ground that such\\nExt. 9 cannot be treated as an evidence. The Learned Trial Court also observed\\nthat if any document is inadvertently exhibited in evidence it does not prove the\\nfacts stated in such document when it is not supported by the pleadings of the\\nparty concerned who presents such document. In such circumstances, the\\nLearned Trial Court held that there was no justification to refer the matter to any\\nexpert for verification of signatures of the said Tapati Rakshit. In such\\ncircumstances it cannot be said that Ext. 9 was admitted by the respondent. It\\nwill also appear from the facts and circumstances of the present case that an\\nHon’ble Single Judge of this court by order dated 30th June, 2005 passed in C.O.\\nNo. 2097 of 2005 was pleased to observe that it appeared that the allegations\\nmade by the appellant were concocted for the purpose of filing the application for\\namendment of written statement in the second suit and the application for\\namendment of the written statement was filed to drag the suit. It will also appear\\nfrom the facts and circumstances of the present case that in C.O. No. 3413 of\\n2005 an Hon’ble Single Judge of this court by order dated 07.04.2006 was also\\npleased to observe that when a document was admitted in evidence, it does notmean that the contents of such document are sacrocant, particularly, when such\\ndocument is admitted with objection. Ext. 9 was marked as an exhibit in spite of\\nobjection being raised on behalf of the respondent. The facts and circumstances\\nof the present case, thus, shows that Ext. 9 was not at all an admitted document\\nand the contents of Ext. 9 was also not proved in accordance with law. An\\nHon’ble Single of this Court in the said order dated 07.04.2006 (passed in C.O.\\nNo. 3413 of 2005) was also pleased to direct that the Learned Trial Judge shall\\nconsider the relevance and evidentiary value of such alleged agreement being Ext.\\n9 at the time of final hearing of the suit. The findings of the Learned Courts\\nbelow in this regard have been against the appellant. The Hon’ble Supreme\\nCourt in A.I.R. 1980 Supreme Court 1109, as indicated earlier, has been\\npleased to observe that it is well settled that no evidence can be looked into by\\nthe Court for which there is no foundation in the pleadings. Apart from the fact\\nthat Ext. 9 does not have any foundation in the pleadings, this court on two\\noccasions affirmed the Trial Court’s order that the appellant cannot be permitted\\nto amend his pleadings for the purpose of introducing Ext. 9 in the pleadings. In\\nsuch circumstances, Ext. 9 cannot be looked into. Since Ext. 9 cannot be looked\\ninto the argument made by the Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant that\\nadverse inference should be drawn from the fact that Tapati Rakshit was not\\nexamined as a witness in the context of Ext. 9 becomes an argument without any\\nsubstance. His other submission that it is important to note that there is no\\nfinding on record that Ext. 9 had not been signed by Tapati Rakshit also cannot\\nstand. The respondent made an application for verification of the signatures ofTapati Rakshit on the document being Ext. 9 since it was the respondent’s case\\nthat the said Ext. 9 is a fraudulent document but such application was rejected\\non the grounds that the said Ext. 9 is meaningless and cannot be considered as\\nan evidence. Thus it is immaterial that there is no finding that the said Ext. 9\\nhas not been signed by Tapati Rakshit. The argument made by the Learned\\nSenior Counsel for the appellant that it is immaterial that the appellant could not\\namend his pleadings since Ext. 9 is only a piece of evidence and it need not be\\npleaded also cannot be accepted in the facts and circumstances of the present\\ncase. The orders passed by the two revisional courts, as indicated earlier, do not\\nallow the appellant to make such submissions. Ext. 9 cannot be relied upon by\\nthe appellant as it has no foundation in the pleadings. This Court cannot\\nreconsider the matter which has already been agitated by the appellant in the\\nrevisional jurisdiction of this court earlier. The decision reported in A.I.R. 1970\\nSupreme Court 1, as already indicated above, has to be borne in mind. The\\ndecision reported at (2000) 1 Supreme Court Cases 434 cannot be of any\\nassistance to the appellant since in that case the application under Section 115\\nCPC was dismissed by the High Court as it was found that it was not a “case\\ndecided” as contemplated under Section 115 CPC.\\nThus, this Court finds that the appellant cannot rely upon Ext. 9 as it\\ncannot be looked into since it has no foundation in the pleadings. The\\nappellant’s efforts to amend his pleadings have stood rejected upto this court on\\nearlier occasions.In view of the discussions made above, this court does not find any merit\\nin the instant appeals which are, accordingly, dismissed. The judgement and\\ndecrees passed by the Learned Lower Appellate Court are affirmed.\\nThere shall, however, be no order as to costs.\\nUrgent Xerox certified copy of this judgement, if applied for by the parties,\\nbe given to the parties as expeditiously as possible on compliance of usual\\nformalities.\\n( TAPAN KUMAR DUTT, J. )',\n",

Both the appeals are directed against the judgment and\\norder of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Additional Sessions\\nJudge, 2nd Court, Burdwan in Sessions Trial No. 7 of 2007, thereby convicting\\nthe accused appellants under Section 302 / 34 of the Indian Penal Code and\\nsentencing each of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine\\nof Rs.6,000/- each, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further\\nperiod of one year.\\nOn the basis of a complaint lodged by one Bishnupada Dutta (P.W.2),\\nfather-in-law of the victim, a case was registered with Khandaghosh Police\\nStation being P.S. Case No. 46 of 2006 dated 17.08.2006 under Section 376/302\\nof the Indian Penal Code.

None was examined on behalf of the defence.\\nThe defence was a plea of innocence and denial of allegation made against them and that\\nthey have been falsely implicated in this case due to enmity, political rivalry, family dispute and\\ndispute over landed property.\\nP.W. 1, Kartick Chandra Roy was the father of the victim and he stated in his evidence\\nthat on 16.08.2006 after receiving the death news of his daughter, he came to the matrimonial\\nhome of his daughter and found the deadbody of his daughter lying on the eastern side of the\\npond. He was a witness to the inquest and also to the seizure list.\\nP.W. 2 Bishnu Pada Dutta, father-in-law of the victim, corroborated his earlier statement\\nin the FIR and he further stated that he was informed by P.W. 11 Jyotsna that accused Dilip and\\nBhombal were found jostling with Khuku (the victim) in the pond.

It was pointed out by Mr. Bose,\\nlearned Advocate that particulars of the case was mentioned at the top of the Inquest report,\\nalthough at that point of time there was no existence of such case. The Investigating Officer of\\nthe case did not claim to have received the particulars of the case from the police station nor did\\nhe say that he mentioned the particulars of the case after the case was registered. Mr. Bose\\nfurther pointed out that after the deadbody of the victim was recovered, P.W. 12 Tarun Dutta\\ninformed the police over telephone about the incident. Although he claimed himself to be an\\neyewitness he did not disclose what he had seen to the police. It is also not understood what\\nprevented him from being the first informant although the incident was within his knowledge.\\nMr. Bose, learned Advocate relied upon a judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court reported in (2009)\\n1 SCC (Cri) 212 (Ramesh Baburao Devaskar & Others Vs State of Maharashtra). In the said\\njudgment it was held by the Hon’ble Apex Court that a first information report in a murder case\\ncannot be lodged after the Inquest is held.\\nMr. Bose next pointed out that although at the time of holding inquest the inmates of the\\nhouse as also other villagers, including P.Ws. 11 and 12, were present, none of them disclosed\\nthe names of the assailants. P.W. 11 claimed to have seen the incident of jostling between the\\naccused persons and the victim and P.W. 12 also claimed to have seen the second part of the\\nincident. But none of them came forward and stated the names of assailants before the Inquest\\nOfficer.8\\nIt was the contention of Mr. Bose that P.W. 11, although she claimed to have seen the\\nincident that the victim Chandra was fighting with accused Dilip and Bhombal in the water, she\\ndid not raise any alarm. She just saw the incident of struggling between the accused and the\\nvictim and returned to her house and did not disclose it to anybody till 18.08.2006 before\\nShyamal Dutta P.W. 18 for the first time. It appears from the evidence on record that at the time\\nwhen the deadbody of Chandra was recovered, both P.W. 11 Jyotsna and P.W. 12 Tarun Dutta\\nwere present amongst other villagers in the searching party. But even at that stage neither P.W.\\n11 nor P.W. 12 stated anything about the incident, which they had seen earlier. It was submitted\\nby Mr. Bose learned Advocate that in a case of this nature, where the prosecution relied upon the\\nevidence of P.Ws. 11 and 12 as eyewitnesses, who did not disclose the names of assailants for two\\ndays after the incident, such non-disclosure was a serious infirmity destroying the prosecution\\ncase. Mr. Bose relied upon a judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court reported in AIR 1976 SC 2488\\n(State of Orissa Vs Mr. Brahmananda Nanda). From a reading of the said judgment we find\\nthat in the said case prosecution depended upon the evidence of a person claiming to be an\\neyewitness, who for a day and a half after the incident, did not disclose the incident to others. It\\nwas held by the Hon’ble Apex Court that such non-disclosure was a serious infirmity, which\\ndestroyed the credibility of the entire evidence.\\nOn the same point learned Advocate also relied upon a judgment of the Apex Court\\nreported in 1996 SCC (Cri) 1028 (Alil Mollah & Another Vs State of West Bengal). In the said\\ncase it was held by the Apex Court that conviction can be based on the testimony of single\\neyewitness if he is wholly reliable and corroboration was required when he is partly reliable. It\\nwas held by the Apex Court that conduct of the witness in not telling anyone about the incident\\ntill next day, was unnatural creating an impression that he had not witnessed the incident and in\\nsuch circumstances no conviction can be founded on his uncorroborated testimony.\\nRelying upon the aforesaid two judgments it was submitted by Mr. Bose, learned Advocate\\nthat the evidence of P.Ws. 11 and 12, who claimed themselves to be the eyewitnesses, was wholly9\\nunreliable. None of them disclosed about the incident to anybody for the next two days. When\\nthe villagers were searching for the victim, these two witnesses, although they were very much\\npresent there, did not disclose to others about the incident which they had seen earlier. Even\\nbefore the Inquest Officer they did not disclose the incident which they had seen earlier. Their\\nconduct in not telling anybody about the incident makes their evidence not worthy of acceptance.\\nNow comes the extra-judicial confession. It was argued by Mr. Bose that it should not be\\nlost sight of that such extra-judicial confession was made before P.W. 18, Shyamal Dutta in\\npresence of his brother Tarun Dutta (P.W. 12) and Shyamal was a practising lawyer of Burdwan\\nCourt and his brother Tarun (P.W. 12) was a clerk in the court of District Judge, Burdwan. It\\nwas argued by Mr. Bose that there was no reason for accused Dilip to choose Shyamal Dutta of\\nall the villagers to make such confession, specially when it is in the evidence on record (evidence\\nof P.W. 9) that Shyamal Dutta and accused Dilip belonged to two rival political parties. So it was\\nvery difficult to believe that of all the persons in the village accused Dilip would select Shyamal,\\nwho belonged to a rival political party and was in inimical terms to make such confession. Mr.\\nBose also pointed out that although such extra-judicial confession was allegedly made before\\nP.Ws. 18 and 12, none of them disclosed anything about such extra-judicial confession to any\\nother witness and not even to the police.\\nMr. Bose relied upon a judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court reported in AIR 1990 SC\\n2140 (Kishore Chand Vs State of Himachal Pradesh), wherein it was held by the Hon’ble Apex\\nCourt as follows :\\n“Therefore, the Court has to look into the surrounding circumstances and to\\nfind whether the extra-judicial confession is not inspired by any improper or\\ncollateral consideration or circumvention of the law suggesting that it may not be\\ntrue one. For this purpose the Court must scrutinise all the relevant facts such as\\nthe person to whom the confession is made, the time and place of making it, the\\ncircumstances in which it was made and finally the actual words used by the10\\naccused. Extra-judicial confession if found to be voluntary can be relied upon by the\\nCourt along with other evidence on record. Therefore, even the extra-judicial\\nconfession will also have to be proved like any other fact. The value of the evidence\\nas to the confession depends upon the veracity of the witness to whom it is made\\nand the circumstances in which it came to be made and the actual words used by\\nthe accused. Sometimes it may not be possible to the witness to reproduce the\\nactual words in which the confession was made. For that reason the law insists on\\nrecording the statement by a Judicial Magistrate after administrating all necessary\\nwarnings to the accused that it would be used as evidence against him.”\\nMr. Bose also relied upon a judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court reported in AIR 1982 SC\\n1595 (Heramba Brahma Vs State of Assam). In paragraph 18 of the said judgment it was held\\nby the Apex Court as follows :\\n“18. We are at a loss to understand how the High Court accepted the\\nevidence on this extra-judicial confession without examining the credentials of P.W.\\n2 Bistiram ; without ascertaining the words used ; without referring to the decision\\nof this Court to be presently mentioned wherein it is succinctly stated that extra-\\njudicial confession to afford a piece of reliable evidence must pass the test of\\nreproduction of exact words, the reason or motive for confession and person\\nselected in whom confidence is reposed.”\\nNext judgment relied upon by Mr. Bose was reported in AIR 1983 SC 295 (Manzoor Vs\\nState of U.P.). In the said judgment the Hon’ble Apex Court while dealing with the extra-judicial\\nconfession made by the appellants, found that there was nothing on record to show that the\\nappellants had any reason to take a particular witness, before whom confessional statement was\\nmade, into confidence and to believe that he could save them from the trouble. Supreme Court\\nrefused to accept the evidence of the witness, before whom such confessional statement was\\nmade, that the appellants made any extra-judicial confession to him. The appeal was accordingly\\nallowed.\\nRelying on the aforesaid judgments it was submitted by the learned Advocate of the\\nappellant that it would not be safe to rely upon the evidence of P.W. 18 and P.W. 12 keeping in11\\nview the fact that they belonged to a rival political party, which was in the evidence of P.W. 9. It\\nwas pointed out by Mr. Bose that P.W. 18 Shyamal was a practising lawyer of Burdwan District\\nCourt and his brother Tarun (P.W. 12) was a clerk in the District Judge’s Court. Accused Dilip\\nwas in inimical terms with P.W. 18 Shyamal as they belonged to rival political party. It was\\ndifficult to believe that accused Dilip would make a confessional statement before P.W. 18, who\\nbelonged to a rival political party. P.W. 12 Tarun Dutta also cannot be accepted as a trustworthy\\nwitness. Although he claimed himself to be an eyewitness, he did not disclose anything to any of\\nthe villagers for next two days. He was with the villagers when they were searching for the victim.\\nHe was present when the deadbody was found. He was also present when police came to village\\nand held inquest. At no point of time he disclosed the incident he had seen to anybody.\\nAlthough it was claimed by P.W. 12 that confession was made by accused Dilip before P.W. 18 in\\nhis presence, he never disclosed anything about such extra-judicial confession to any of the\\nvillagers or to the police.\\nIt was pointed out by Mr. Bose that P.W. 12 inspite of seeing a part of the incident did not\\ninform the police on the first available opportunity although he informed the police over phone.\\nDuring this period appellant was present at the spot and not only signed the inquest report,\\nwhich was prepared on 16.08.2006, but had also accompanied the family members of the victim\\nfor cremation of the deadbody on the following day. What is strange here is that inspite of the fact\\nthat the appellant Dilip was all-along present with the villagers, including P.Ws. 11 and 12, they\\ndid not utter a single word against him. When police arrived at the village P.Ws. 11 and 12 had\\nample opportunity to make a disclosure of facts within their knowledge, but nothing was said\\nagainst the appellants.\\nNext circumstance relied upon by the learned Trial Judge was recovery of “saree’ from the\\npond known as “Lakhpukur”. P.W. 13, who was a local person according to the prosecution,\\nwitnessed the seizure of ‘saree’ and he had signed the seizure list. However, when Material Ext. 1\\n(saree) was shown to him he failed to identify the same. P.W. 13 further gave out that after12\\nrecovery of the ‘saree’ the accused persons came to the spot. Such admission by P.W. 13 being\\nunfavourable for the prosecution, he was declared hostile. Mr. Bose pointed out that P.W. 14\\nanother witness to the seizure, was also declared hostile. This witness in his evidence-in-chief\\ndid not state that such recovery of saree was made pursuant to confessional statement of the\\naccused and that accused persons were present at the spot at the time of such recovery. P.W. 15\\nwas another seizure witness and he was a man of different village. It was his own evidence that\\nhe had good terms with the police and he used to help police in different work and used to work\\nas per direction of the police. Mr. Bose further pointed out that P.W. 15 claimed to have recovered\\nthe ‘saree”. Strangely enough P.W. 4 stated that P.Ws. 16 and 21 had recovered the ‘saree’, while\\nP.W. 5 stated that it was P.W. 14, who recovered the ‘saree’. So, as regards recovery of the saree\\nthere was serious contradiction in the evidence of those witnesses.\\nLastly it was submitted by Mr. Bose that there was a glaring inconsistency between the\\nocular and medical evidence and it would be extremely unsafe to maintain the conviction of the\\nappellants on such evidence. Referring to the evidence of P.W. 23, the autopsy surgeon it was\\nsubmitted by Mr. Bose that opinion of P.W. 23 was that death was caused by manual\\nstrangulation and was ante mortem and homicidal in nature. In his cross-examination P.W. 23\\nstated that he found 9 ante mortem injuries on the body. The evidence of autopsy surgeon was\\nan important piece of evidence to judge the veracity of the prosecution case. Mr. Bose pointed out\\nthat death was not the result of dashing the head of the victim against the bank of the pond as\\nalleged by the prosecution. That apart, the nature of injuries as found by P.W. 23 does not\\nconform to the manner of assault as purportedly stated in the extra-judicial confession made by\\nthe appellant before P.W. 18. The manner of assault as projected by the prosecution through the\\nevidence of P.Ws. 11, 12 and 18 was to the effect of dashing the head of the victim on the bank of\\nthe pond whereas according to the evidence of P.W. 23 death was due to manual strangulation.\\nMr. Goswami, learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent / State submitted\\nthat in the present case there were two eyewitnesses to the incident. P.W. 11 Jyotsna saw the13\\nfirst part of the incident when victim Chandra was found fighting with the accused appellants in\\nthe pond. She had given a description of what she had seen on the date of incident. The second\\npart of the incident was seen by P.W. 12 Tarun Dutta. He found both the accused appellants to\\nplace a deadbody under a wood apple tree on the northern side of the pond. It was the\\nsubmission of Mr. Goswami that these two witnesses were cross-examined at length, but nothing\\ninfirm could be elicited from their cross-examination to cast even a slightest doubt on the veracity\\nof these two witnesses. There was no reason to disbelieve P.Ws. 11 and 12. Delay in disclosure\\nof the incident to other witnesses might be for various reasons, but such non-disclosure cannot\\nbe a ground for demolishing the prosecution case. It was the contention of Mr. Goswami that\\nwhere the witnesses deposed in court after a lapse of a considerable period, it was quite natural\\nthat there would be minor contradictions in their evidence.\\nMr. Goswami next argued that there was disclosure statement made by the accused and\\npursuant to such statement recovery of “saree” of the victim was made from the pond and the\\nsame was seized by the police under proper seizure list. There was no reason to disbelieve the\\nwitnesses to the seizure only because of some minor discrepancies.\\nReferring to the evidence of the autopsy surgeon (P.W. 23), it was submitted by the\\nlearned Public Prosecutor that it was the definite opinion of the P.M. Doctor that death was\\ncaused by strangulation and the doctor also found as many as 9 injuries on the body of the\\nvictim and opined that such injuries could not be inflicted by one person. So, according to Mr.\\nGoswami, it would not be correct to say that medical evidence was not in conformity with the\\nocular version of P.Ws. 11, 12 and 18.\\nFinally it was submitted by Mr. Goswami that in the present case there was extra-judicial\\nconfession made by accused Dilip before P.W. 18, Shyamal Dutta in presence of his brother,\\nTarun Dutta (P.W. 12). Such extra-judicial confession was made voluntarily by the accused\\nperson and there was no reason to disbelieve P.W. 18 before whom such extra-judicial confession14\\nwas made. Mr. Goswami relied upon a judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court reported in (2007) 12\\nSCC 230 (Aloke Nath Dutta Vs State of West Bengal). Relying upon the aforesaid judgment, it\\nwas submitted by Mr. Goswami that after subjecting the evidence of a witness, before whom\\nextra-judicial confession was made, to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, the extra-\\njudicial confession can be accepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test of\\ncredibility.\\nI have carefully gone through the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court referred to above.\\nThe principle laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court is settled principle of law regarding\\nacceptability of extra judicial confession and there cannot be any dispute regarding the said\\nprinciple. But the facts and circumstances in the case of Aloke Nath Dutta (supra) are totally\\ndifferent from that of the present case. In the case referred to above confession was made before\\na number of witnesses and no suggestion was given to any of the witnesses regarding enmity\\nbetween the parties. But in the present case definite suggestion was given to P.W. 18 regarding\\nenmity between P.W. 18 and accused Dilip over a land dispute (page 70 of the paper book). That\\napart it appears from the evidence of P.W. 9 that he stated in his cross-examination that P.W. 18,\\nShyamal Dutta and accused Dilip belonged to rival political parties (page 36 of the paper book).\\nI have heard the learned Advocates of the respective parties. I have perused the\\nJudgments of the Hon’ble Apex Court referred to above and I have also scrutinized the entire\\nevidence on record. In the present case prosecution mainly relied upon the evidence of P.Ws. 11\\nand 12, recovery of ‘saree’ from the pond pursuant to the confessional statement made by the\\naccused to the police and the extra-judicial confession made by accused Dilip before P.W. 18.\\nP.W. 11, Jyotsna was a witness to the first part of the incident and P.W. 12 was a witness to the\\nsecond part of the incident as I have already discussed above. But surprisingly none of these two\\nwitnesses disclosed such incident to any of the villagers for the next two days. When the villagers\\nwere searching for the victim, these two witnesses were present amongst the searching party.\\nBut they did not disclose anything to the other members of the searching party. Same thing15\\nhappened when the deadbody of the victim was found and police arrived and held inquest over\\nthe deadbody. None of them came forward claiming to be an eyewitness. When the deadbody\\nwas taken to burning ghat for cremation, both P.W. 12 and 18 were present, but nothing was\\ndisclosed by P.W. 12 either to his elder brother Shyamal (P.W. 18) or to any family member of the\\nvictim. Where in a case of this nature, the entire prosecution depended upon the evidence of\\nP.Ws. 11 and 12 claiming to be eyewitnesses and where none of the said witnesses disclosed the\\nincident for the next two days and where there was no satisfactory explanation for such non-\\ndisclosure, it was a serious infirmity, which destroyed the credibility of the evidence of these two\\nwitnesses. The conduct of these two witnesses was quite unnatural and their evidence, in my\\nconsidered view, does not inspire confidence. In this regard, I find sufficient merit in the\\nsubmission made by Mr. Bose, learned Advocate and I am of the view that the judgments of the\\nApex Court in the case of Brahmananda Nanda (supra) and in the case of Alil Mollah (supra) are\\nvery much applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case.\\nAs regards the extra-judicial confession made by accused Dilip to P.W. 18, I find sufficient\\nmerit in the submission made by Mr. Bose. The value of such type of evidence depends upon the\\nveracity of the witness to whom such confession was made and the circumstances in which it was\\nmade. Such confession was allegedly made to P.W. 18, Shyamal by accused Dilip. It is in the\\nevidence on record that there was an enmity between P.W. 18 Shyamal and accused Dilip over\\nthe dispute of landed property and it is also in the evidence on record (evidence of P.W. 9) that\\nP.W. 18 and accused Dilip belonged to two rival political parties. So it is clear that relation\\nbetween P.W. 18 and accused Dilip was inimical. In such circumstances, there was no reason for\\naccused Dilip to select P.W. 18 of all the persons to make such confession. The evidence of P.W.\\n18 also does not inspire confidence. Although such confession was made to P.W. 18, he never\\ndisclosed such fact of extra–judicial confession to any of the villagers and not even to the police.\\nIn view of the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court, relied upon by the learned Advocate of the\\nappellant, in the case of Kishore Chand (supra) and Heramba Brahma (supra) I am unable to\\naccept such evidence of extra-judicial confession made by accused Dilip to P.W. 18.16\\nAs regards the recovery of saree from the pond pursuant to the confessional statement of\\naccused, I find that there are serious contradictions in the evidence of P.Ws. 13, 14, 15 and 16,\\nwho claimed themselves as witnesses to the seizure. P.W. 13 stated in his evidence that after\\nrecovery of saree the accused persons came to the spot. P.W. 14 did not say anything about such\\nrecovery and in his evidence-in-chief did not state that pursuant to the information given by the\\naccused persons recovery of saree was made. In his cross- examination P.W. 14 further deposed\\nthat the accused persons were not even present at the spot during such recovery. P.W. 15,\\nanother seizure witness, stated in his evidence that he had good relation with the police and used\\nto help the police in various work and used to act as per direction of the police. P.W. 15 also did\\nnot find any mark of mud in the ‘saree’ when it was shown to him. P.W. 16 in his cross-\\nexamination stated that the ‘saree’ was recovered from inside the pond and it was stained with\\nmud. However, when the ‘saree’ was produced in court he did not find any marks of mud on it.\\nP.W. 16 also stated that he did not put his signature on the said ‘saree’ nor was any label pasted\\non it. In view of the nature of evidence of the witnesses to the seizure of ‘saree’, it is difficult for\\nthis court to accept the prosecution version that there was recovery of ‘saree’ pursuant to the\\nconfessional statement made by the accused.\\nIn view of the discussion made above I find sufficient merit in the submission made by the\\nlearned Advocate of the appellant. In my considered view prosecution failed to prove its case\\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\\nThe matter was referred to this Bench by the Hon’ble Chief Justice in terms of Section 392\\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure as the two learned Judges of this court divided in opinion in\\ndisposing of the appeals. After hearing the parties and scrutinizing evidence on record, I agree\\nwith the view of my learned brother, Justice Amit Talukdar and allow the present two appeals.17\\nThe appeals are accordingly allowed. Judgment and order of conviction and sentence are\\nset aside and the accused appellants are acquitted of the charge framed against them.\\nThe accused appellant, Dilip Kumar Dey @ Dilip @ Dilu, who is now in judicial custody,\\nshall be released forthwith, if he is not wanted in any other case. The appellant, Sristidhar Roy @\\nBhombal @ Hambul, who is now on bail, shall be discharged from his bail bond.\\nA copy of this judgement along with LCR may be sent down to the court below\\nimmediately.\\nUrgent Xerox certified copy of this judgment and order may be supplied to\\nthe learned Advocates of the respective parties, if the same is applied for.\\n(DEBIPRASAD SENGUPTA, J.)',\n",
              " 'IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA\\nCriminal Appellate Jurisdiction\\nPRESENT:\\nTHE HON’BLE MR JUSTICE KALIDAS MUKHERJEE\\nCRA NO. 601 OF 2003\\nMd. Mizan & Anr.\\nVs.\\nThe State of West Bengal\\nFor the Appellants: Mr. C. R. Bag, Sr. Advocate\\nMr. C.S. Bag,\\nMr. M. S. Mondal\\nMr. Abhik Pal\\nFor the State: Mr. S. S. Roy\\nHEARD ON: 05.02.08, 08.02.2008, 14.02.2008 and 15.02.08.\\nJUDGMENT ON:25.02.2008.\\nKALIDAS MUKHERJEE, J.\\n:\\n1. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and\\nsentence passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court –\\n4, Raghunathpur in Sessions Trial No. 2(1) of 2003 corresponding toSessions Case No. 63 of 2000 convicting thereby the appellants under\\nSection 363 I.P.C. and sentencing each of them to suffer R.I. for 4 years\\nand to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- I.d. to suffer R.I. for one year. Appellant\\nMd. Mizan has been convicted and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for\\nfive years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- I.d. to suffer R.I. for one year\\nunder Section 366A I.P.C. No separate sentence was passed by the learned\\nTrial Judge against convict Niamul Hoque under Section 366A I.P.C. The\\nappellant Md. Mizan has also been convicted and sentenced to suffer R.I.\\nfor seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- I.d. to suffer R.I. for one\\nand half years under Section 376 I.P.C. with the direction that the\\nsentences shall run concurrently.\\n2. The prosecution case, in short, is that the informant Gulzar Hossain lodged\\ncomplaint with Raghunathpur P.S. on 17.08.96 alleging that his daughter\\naged less than 16 years and a student of class – IX in Cheliama Girls High\\nSchool went to the school, but, did not return home on 13.08.96. On\\n14.08.96 the informant lodged a missing diary with Raghunathpur P.S.\\nDuring search the informant came to learn that on the date of incident i.e.\\non 13.08.96 during the tiffin hours at about 1.30 P.M. Niamul Hoque took\\nher away from the school. The victim was taken to Md. Mizan who took\\nher to Cehliama bus stand. Thereafter the victim girl was enticed away to\\nPurulia by a trekker and they spent one night in the house of one Munna\\nTailor near Purulia Court. Thereafter they stayed in a house near Islamia\\nhotel at Dhanbad Road. Taking advantage of the minority of the victimgirl, Mizan might have married and committed rape upon her. Upon\\nreceipt of the complaint, the Raghunathpur P.S. case No. 47 of 1996 was\\nstarted and after completion of investigation charge sheet was submitted.\\nThe charges were framed against the accused persons under Section 363,\\n366A and 366A/109 I.P.C. against both the accused persons. The charge\\nof Section 376 I.P.C. was also framed against the accused Md. Mizan. Both\\nthe accused persons pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\\n3. Mr. Bag, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submits\\nthat the incident occurred on 13th of August, 1996 and on the next day\\nmissing diary was lodged and on 17th August, 1996 the F.I.R. was lodged\\nby the informant. Mr. Bag contends that there is no evidence of enticing\\naway the victim girl. Mr. Bag contends that from the evidence of the P.Ws.\\nit would appear that if the victim left the school, she had left voluntarily\\nand the learned Trial Court failed to appreciate the evidence from its proper\\nperspective. Mr. Bag contends that learned Trial Court ought to have\\nrelied on the ossification test which clearly shows that the victim girl was\\nmajor on the date of alleged incident. It is contended that no shouts or\\nhue and cry was raised by the victim girl while she was allegedly taken\\naway. It is further contended that there was no mark of violence on the\\nprivate parts of the victim girl. It is contended that medical evidence was\\nnot properly considered by the learned Trial Court and the absence of\\nhymen, ifsofacto, is not the conclusive proof of alleged commission of rape\\nupon the victim girl. Mr. Bag contends that the learned JudicialMagistrate recorded the statement of the victim girl under Section 164\\nCr.P.C. in a casual manner. Mr. Bag contends that the learned Trial Court\\nwas not justified in recording the judgment of conviction and sentence\\nagainst the appellants.\\n4. Mr. S. S. Roy , learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State submits\\nthat the date of birth as noted in the admission register of the school which\\nwas produced at the time of trial before the learned Court below should be\\nrelied upon. Mr. Roy contends that when the admission register of the\\nschool has been produced to prove the age of the victim girl, the\\nossification test report should not be relied upon. Mr. Roy contends that\\nthere is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of the prosecutrix and the\\nstatement made by her before the learned Magistrate under Section 164\\nCr.P.C. Mr. Roy contends that the evidence adduced by the prosecution\\nwas sufficient to prove the charges levelled against the appellants and\\nthere is no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment passed by the\\nlearned Trial Court.\\n5. The learned Trial Judge while recording the judgment of conviction and\\nsentence held that the statement of the victim girl under Section 164\\nCr.P.C., made earlier in point of time, was corroborated at the time of trial\\nby her oral testimony. As regards the age of the victim girl the learned\\nJudge discussed the entries made in the admission register (Exhibit – 8)\\nand the ossification test report and relied on the entries in the admission\\nregister wherein the date of birth of the victim girl was recorded as on22.04.1982. The learned Trial Judge held that the victim girl was\\nkidnapped and thereafter by promise of marriage as well as creating fear in\\nthe mind of the victim, accused Mizan committed rape on the victim girl. It\\nhas also been held that the victim girl was minor on the date of incident.\\nThe learned Judge ultimately held that the prosecution has been able to\\nsubstantiate the charge under Section 363, 366A and 376 I.P.C. against\\nthe accused Md. Mizan. As against the other appellant Niyamul Hoque the\\nlearned Judge held that the prosecution has been able to substantiate the\\ncharges under Sections 363, 366A/109 I.P.C. and recorded the sentences\\naforesaid.\\n6. Prosecution in this case has examined as may as 13 P.Ws. including the\\nvictim girl, her father, other witnesses of the same village, the\\nHeadmistress of the school, the Doctor and the I.O. The defence examined\\none D.W. Sri Paresh Mukherjee, Headmaster of Cheliama Bijaliprava High\\nSchool where accused Niamul Hoque was a student of class XI. It is the\\ndefence contention that on 13.08.96 accused Niamul Hoque attended his\\nclass and the attendance register was produced by the Headmaster\\n(Exhibit – A).\\n7. P.W. 1 is the victim girl who has stated that on 13.08.96 during tiffin hours\\nof the school, Niamul Hoque in order to talk to her called her away;\\naccused Mizan was standing there; Niamul Hoque gave her a betel leaf and\\nafter chewing the same she felt reeling of head. It is in her evidence that\\nNiamul thereafter took her to Mizan and then she was taken by Mizan by atrekker to the house of Munna Tailor at Purulia where Mizan expressed his\\ndesire to marry her and further told her that in case of refusal he would\\ntorture upon her parents. She has further stated that on that night the\\naccused Mizan tried to commit rape upon her, but, due to menstruation he\\ncould not cohabit; On 14th August, 1996 she was taken to Chirkunda by\\nMizan and therefrom to Barakar; after taking meal on that date she was\\ntaken to Beliapur to the house of Akbar, a friend of Mizan. It is in her\\nevidence that she was forcibly raped there by accused Mizan for three days.\\nIt is in her evidence that on 17.08.96 she was taken to Gobindapur where\\naccused Mizan contacted Moulana to arrange for marriage and on 18th\\nAugust, 1996 on getting information her father reached the said place and\\nrecovered her with the help of police. She has stated that she was\\nmedically examined on 18th August and on 19th August she was produced\\nbefore the learned Magistrate where she made a statement.\\n8. In the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. victim girl\\ncategorically stated that on 13.08.96 during tiffin hours Niamul Hoque\\ncalled her away and he gave her a betel leaf and chocolate and after\\nchewing the same her head started reeling. It is also in her statement that\\nshe was taken to Purulia, Chirkunda and Beliapur. At Beliapur she stayed\\nfor three days in the house of a person who was known to Mizan. She has\\ncategorically stated that in the said house Mizan committed rape upon her\\nforcibly for three days.9. The father of the victim girl has been examined as P.W. 2 who has\\ncorroborated the F.I.R. P.W. 3 who is a resident of the same village has\\nstated that on 13.8.96 after closing his shop in the Bazar he saw Niamul\\nand Mizan coming out of the school with the victim girl and then Mizan\\nand the victim girl boarded a trekker and proceeded towards Purulia. P.W.\\n4 is the mother of the victim girl who has stated that on the date of\\nincident her daughter had gone to school, but, did not return home and on\\n1st Bhadra i.e. on the sixth day after the incident her daughter returned.\\nP.W. 5 Samsuddin Answary is a tenant in the complex of Islam Hotel at\\nvillage Gobindapur and in the evening he saw that a girl and a boy came\\nfrom Bengal to the house of Raffique Laskar and on the following day police\\ncame there and recovered the girl.\\n10. P.W. 6 Murad Hossain Mirdhya was declared hostile by the prosecution.\\nP.W. 7 is the Doctor who examined the victim girl and found the following\\ninjuries:\\n“No external injury seen over the breast (both) & private organ also. No\\nbleeding through vagina. Pubic hair shaved about 4-5 days.\\nNo vaginal discharge and blood seen at present. Hymen absent (not\\nseen).”(Exhibit – 5).\\n11. In the cross-examination P.W. 7 has stated that it was very difficult to\\nopine and further investigation was needed. P.W. 9 is the staff of CheliamaB. C. Girls’ High School who has stated that as per the admission register\\nof the school the date of birth of victim girl was 22.04.1982. The admission\\nregister has been marked Exhibit 8. P.W. 11 is the seizure witnesses. P.W.\\n12 and P.W. 13 are the Investigating Officers.\\n12. It is the settled law that in a case under Section 376 I.P.C. the evidence of\\nthe prosecutrix itself is sufficient to warrant conviction, if it inspires\\nconfidence. In such a case corroboration is not necessary. In the instant\\ncase, the statement made by the victim girl recorded under Section 164\\nCr.P.C. was corroborated by her in her evidence at the time of trial. It is\\nclear therefrom that during the tiffin hours of the school, accused Niamul\\nHoque called her away and Mizan took her to different places. It is also\\nclear from the evidence that Niamul gave her a betel leaf and chocolate\\nwhich caused her head reeling. She has categorically stated in her\\nstatement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and deposition during trial that at\\nBeliapur accused Mizan forcibly committed rape upon her for three days.\\nFrom her evidence and the evidence of her father (P.W. 2) it is also clear\\nthat she was recovered with the help of police.\\n13. Now as regards the medicolegal evidence it is clear from the evidence of\\nDoctor that hymen was absent. The absence of mark of violence on her\\nbody and private parts does not, by itself, render her testimony incredible\\nor does not cast any shadow of doubt in her testimony. Nothing has been\\nelicited in her cross-examination so as to raise any suspicion as to the\\nveracity of the prosecution case.14. Mr. Bag, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in this\\nconnection submits that the victim girl did not raise any hue and cry or\\nshouts while she was allegedly taken to the bus stand or other places. Mr.\\nBag submits that this was not in consonance with probability. But I am\\nunable to accept such contention of Mr. Bag. In this connection it is clear\\nfrom her testimony that she was put under constant threat and\\nintimidation and thereby Mizan forcibly ravished her sexually. Under such\\ncircumstances, the absence of mark of violence does not create any doubt.\\n15. As regards the plea of alibi of accused Niamul Hoque, the Headmaster of\\nthe school has been examined as D.W. 1 who has stated that on 13.08.96\\nas per the attendance register Niamul Hoque was present in the class. The\\nclass teacher has not been examined. Although accused Niamul Hoque\\nwas marked present in the attendance register, it does not, by itself,\\nsuggest that the accused Niamil Hoque was present in the class during the\\nentire school hours. The class teacher or any student of the class, if\\nexamined, could say whether or not Niamul was present in the class at the\\nmaterial time. Moreover, this plea was not taken at the earliest point of\\ntime. During cross-examination of the victim or other P.Ws., no such\\nspecific question was put to them that on 13.8.96 Niamul was present in\\nthe class. The plea of alibi, therefore, is unacceptable.\\n16. Regarding the age of the victim girl it has been mentioned in the F.I.R. that\\nshe was less than 16 years of age. The admission register of the school\\nwas produced and the Headmistress has been examined as P.W. 10. Shehas stated that as per the admission register the date of birth of the victim\\ngirl was 22.04.82 (Exhibit 8).\\n17. According to the ossification test report (Exhibit 12), the victim girl was\\nabove 20 years and below 25 years. Mr. Roy in this connection has\\nreferred to and relied on the decisions reported in (2006)1 SCC (Cri) 217\\n[Vishnu Alias Undrya Vs. State of Maharashtra] and (2006)3 SCC (Cri)\\n66 [State of Chhattisgarh Vs. Lekhram]. In the case of State of\\nChhattisgarh Vs. Lekhram, the observation of the Hon’ble Apex Court is\\nset out hereunder:-\\n“12. A register maintained in a school is admissible in evidence to\\nprove date of birth of the person concerned in terms of Section 35 of\\nthe Evidence Act………………...”\\nThe observation of the Hon’ble Apex Court made in para 13 is quoted\\nhereunder:-\\n“13. ………………..It may be true that an entry in the school register is\\nnot conclusive but it has evidentiary value. Such evidentiary value of\\na school register is corroborated by oral evidence as the same was\\nrecorded on the basis of the statement of the mother of the\\nprosecutrix.\"\\nIn the other case Vishnu alias Undrya Vs. State of Maharashtra (Supra) it\\nhas been held by the Hon’ble Apex Court that the opinion of the medical\\nofficer is to assist the Court as he is not a witness of fact and the evidence\\ngiven by the medical officer is really of an advisory character and not\\nbinding on the witness of fact. In the instant case the father of the victim\\ngirl lodged the F.I.R. wherein it has been categorically stated that the\\nvictim girl was below 16 years at the time of occurrence. Relying on thesaid decisions, I find that the learned trial Judge was justified in relying on\\nthe entry in the admission register of the school and holding that the\\nvictim girl was minor at the time of the alleged incident. The question of\\nconsent or leaving the school voluntarily by the victim girl, therefore, does\\nnot arise at all. From the evidence of victim girl it is clear that she was\\nenticed away.\\n18. Considering the evidence on record, I am of the considered opinion that the\\nevidence of prosecutrix is quite natural and inspires confidence. There is\\nnothing to discard her testimony. The contention of animosity between the\\nparties as put to the P.Ws during their cross-examination has not been\\nestablished. The evidence on record is sufficient to warrant conviction and\\nthe learned Trial Judge was, therefore, justified in passing the impugned\\njudgment of conviction and sentence. It calls for no interference in this\\nappeal. There is no merit in this appeal and the same stands dismissed.\\nThe impugned judgment is hereby affirmed. It appears that vide order\\ndated 05.02.2004 the appellant Niamul Hoque was granted bail. The\\nappellant Niamul Hoque is, therefore, directed to surrender before the\\nlearned Trial Court within one month from this date to serve out the\\nsentence, failing which, the learned Trial Court will take necessary action\\naccording to law. Interim order, if any, stands vacated.\\n19. Let a copy of this order be sent immediately to the concerned Correctional\\nHome where the appellant Md. Mizan is detained. Let a copy of this order\\nalong with L.C.R. be sent immediately to the learned Trial Court.20. Urgent Xerox certified copy, if applied for, be handed over to the parties as\\nearly as possible.\\n( Kalidas Mukherjee, J. )',\n",
              " 'IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA\\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\\nPresent: The Hon’ble Mr. Justice Partha Sakha Datta\\nCRA 694 of 2005\\nWith\\nCRAN No. 2044 of 2006\\nManoj Kumar Das @ Gurua\\nVs.\\nState of West Bengal\\nFor the Appellant: Mr. Asraf Ali\\nMr. Salauddin\\nFor the State: Mr. Tapan Dutta Gupta\\nMr. Kollol Mondal\\nHeard on: 02-02-2009\\nDelivered on: 6th March, 2009.\\nPartha Sakha Datta, J.:-\\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No. 1, Jangipur\\nin the district of Murshidabad convicted the appellant under Section 376/417\\nIPC in Sessions Serial No. 48 of 2004 corresponding to Sessions Trial No. 02 of\\n2004 arising out of Suti P.S. Case No. 110 of 2002 and sentenced him to suffer\\nR.I. for 7 years with payment of fine of Rs.35,000/- in default to suffer foranother 2 years on account of the charge under Section 376 IPC and to suffer\\nR.I. for 1 year with payment of fine of Rs.500/- in default to suffer S.I. for one\\nmonth.\\nThe judgment and order of the learned trial court has been appealed\\nagainst in CRA No. 694 of 2005 and it came for consideration before this court on\\n17th September, 2007 and at the time of hearing of the appeal a point was taken\\nthat the appellant in his examination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. stated before the\\nlearned Judge that on the day of examination he was 15 years old. The court’s\\nattention was further drawn to the report of Dr. Alok Biswas (P.W. 6) which goes\\nto show that on the date of examination of the appellant on 11th September, 2002\\nhe was about 15 years old. Thus, with the aid of the medical report of P.W. 6\\n(Exbt. 2) and the statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.c. it was\\ncontended that the appellant ought to have been tried under the Juvenile Justice\\n(Care and Protection) Act 2002; and when the question of juvenility has been\\nraised an enquiry was necessary so as to ascertain the age of the appellant at the\\ntime of the commission of the offence under Section 7(A) of the Act.\\nUpon such submission of the appellant’s advocate and upon hearing the\\nlearned counsel for the State of West Bengal there was a direction upon the\\nlearned trial court to ascertain the age of the appellant on the basis of evidence\\noral and documentary as may be adduced before the trial court and to return its\\nfinding to this court so as to proceed further with the hearing of the appeal.In compliance with the order of this court dated 17th September, 2007 the\\nlearned trial court has returned its finding which requires to be now considered.\\nBefore the learned Judge in the trial court, as it appears from the learned trial\\ncourt’s order dated 11th of January, 2008 the prosecution examined two\\nwitnesses and two documents were produced; one was the school certificate\\nissued by the teacher-in-charge of Uttar Naya Bahadurpur Primary School (Exbt.\\n2) and the relevant entry in the admission register was dated 28th of May, 1991\\n(Exbt. 1). The relevant entry in the admission register of the primary school\\ncorroborated the date of birth of the appellant as described in the school\\ncertificate dated 23rd November, 2007. The school certificate dated 23rd\\nNovember, 2007 issued by the said primary school (Exbt. 2) goes to show that as\\nper admission register of the said school the date of birth of the appellant was\\n10th of January, 1985. As against this, defence proved a school certificate dated\\n29th of November, 2007 issued by Fatullapur S.M. High School showing the date\\nof birth as 10th of January, 1987 but the learned trial court observed that the\\ndefence failed to prove the relevant entry in the admission register of Fatullapur\\nS.M. High School. Thus, the defence failed to prove the foundation of Exbt. A, i.e.\\nthe school certificate dated 29th of November, 2007 which could not carry any\\nweight because the very basis of entry in the school certificate of Fatullapur S.M.\\nHigh School wherein the date of birth was recorded as 10th of January, 1985\\ncould not be established. However, treating 10th of January as the date of birth\\nof the appellant the age of the appellant on the date of the commission of theoffence which was 5th of December 2001 came to be 16 years 10 months and 24\\ndays, i.e. less than 17 years. It was further observed that as regards subsequent\\ncohabitation with the victim on the days as alleged the appellant was also less\\nthan 18 years of age. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000\\ncame into force on and from 1st of April, 2001 with the repeal of the 1986 Act;\\nthus juvenile means one who is under 18 years of age. The date of commission\\nof the offence was 5th of December, 2001 and on that day the accused came to be\\nless than 18 years of age.\\nThus, the appeal is now being proceeded with the finding that appellant on\\nthe date of the commission of the offence was a juvenile. As per the FIR which\\nwas lodged on 5th of September, 2002, 9 months preceding the date of filing of\\nthe FIR which roughly came to be 5th of December, 2001 the accused committed\\nsexual intercourse with the victim against the will of the victim for the first time\\nand then on 8 or 10 occasions subsequently on the promise that he would marry\\nthe victim. The victim conceived and when the proposal of marriage was placed\\nto the appellant he refused. This was the FIR (Exbt. 1/3).\\nThe victim stated before the learned Judge as P.W. 1 that when she had\\nbeen to the house of the accused to meet the sister of the accused Mousumi the\\naccused finding Mousumi not in the house cohabited with the victim who then\\nstarted crying but was threatened. Accused consoled her that he would marry\\nher and then on subsequent occasions such cohabitation did take place. Thishas come out in cross-examination of P.W. 1 that the accused forcibly cohabited\\nwith her and promised to marry and then she starting loving him after such\\ncohabitation. On the date of the evidence of the victim which was 7th of\\nSeptember, 2004 she was 18 years old, which means that on the date of the\\nalleged commission of offence which was 2 years 9 months preceding her giving\\nevidence in court she was 16 years old.\\nP.W. 2, Tapan Das, the father of the victim corroborated the evidence of his\\ndaughter as was reported to him by her. The appellant’s father was reported of\\nthe incident so that a marriage could be arranged but after dilly dallying the\\nappellant’s father avoided. A child was born of such sexual intercourse.\\nP.W. 3, Sisir Kumar Das is the scriber of the FIR.\\nP.W. 4, is Chumki Das, another daughter of P.W. 2 who was aged 12 years\\nand her evidence is that her elder sister had been to house of the appellant and\\nshe found in the evening her elder sister and the appellant lying on a cot. As she\\nentered into the room the appellant went away.\\nEvidence of P.W. 5, Bharati Das is of no relevance.\\nP.W. 6, Dr. Alok Kumar Biswas, as already observed, found that on the day\\nof examination he found the appellant about 15 years. Evidence of this witness\\nis no longer relevant because subsequently on the basis of the documentary\\nevidence it has been found out by the learned trial court that the age of theappellant on the date of the commission of the offence which was 5th of\\nDecember, 2001 was under 18 years.\\nP.W. 7, Mr. Shri Kumar Goswami, the Judicial Magistrate recorded the\\nstatement of the victim which goes to show that in one night in the month of\\nMagh of the year preceding the year of her statement dated 5th of September,\\n2002 the appellant came to her room and committed sexual intercourse against\\nher will.\\nEvidence of P.W. 8, Dr. Pradip Kumar Mishra is of no assistance since\\nmedical examination was done long after the alleged commission of offence and\\nonly it is found that the hymen of the victim was found raptured with vagina\\nremaining intact.\\nDr. Asit Kumar Majumder (P.W. 9), the medical officer of Sub-Divisional\\nHospital at Jangipur took sample of blood of the victim, of her child and of the\\naccused and the result of the Assistant Director (Biology) –cum- Assistant\\nChemical Examiner to the Government of India (Exbt. 6/2) is that the appellant\\nis the biological father of the baby. This finding could not be assailed.\\nAs regards the age of the victim defence examined D.W. 3 Dr. Pratap\\nChandra Saha, the Medical Officer of Sub-Divisional Hospital at Jangipur who\\nconducted ossification test of the victim on 2nd of July, 2003 observed throughhis report that the age of the victim was about 18/19 years old. This biological\\ntest was conducted on the prayer of the I.O. This ascertainment of age as 18/19\\nyears on the date of examination of the victim does not help to ascertain the age\\nof the girl on the date of the alleged commission of the offence which first took\\nplace on 5th of December, 2001. The doctor says in his cross-examination by\\nthis prosecution that it is not possible to say for him whether the actual age of\\nthe victim girl was 16 years or not at the time of the alleged commission of the\\noffence.\\nHaving considered the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution and\\nthe defence it comes to be established without any shadow of doubt that the\\nvictim was sexually intercoursed by the appellant and the controversy rests with\\nthe question whether such sexual intercourse was committed with the consent of\\nthe girl or not. Since D.W. 2 fails to say whether the victim was 16 years at the\\ntime of commission of the offence or not it cannot be definitely concluded that\\nshe was about 16 years of age. Such a conclusion is risky one because\\nossification test report only gives an approximation of age which may vary either\\nby increase or by decrease by 2/3 years. The victim has consistently said in her\\nevidence that she was raped against her will. She has stated that subsequently\\nshe cohabited with the appellant as the latter assured of marrying her.\\nThus, the prosecution case is found to have been established. Since the\\nappellant was a juvenile he has to be dealt with under the Juvenile Justice (Careand Protection) Act 2000. About 27 years have elapsed since the alleged\\ncommission of offence. It is futile now to ask the appellant to be tried under the\\nAct 2000. It appears that the appellant has been in judicial custody since the\\ndate of sentence which is 30th of July, 2005. Accordingly, the appellant be\\nreleased forthwith with the sentence reduced to the period already undergone.\\nThus the appeal is allowed in part.\\nCRAN Application No. 2044 of 2006 also stands disposed of.\\nA copy of this judgment shall be sent to the learned Additional Sessions\\nJudge, Fast Track Court No. 1, Jangipur for information and necessary action\\nand also to the Superintendent of the Correctional Home where the appellant is\\nlodged.\\n(Partha Sakha Datta, J.)',\n",

The facts of the case, in brief, are stated hereinbelow:-\\n(i) The plaintiff- Radio Today Broadcasting Ltd. (hereinafter\\nreferred to as ‘RTB’) instituted the suit against the defendant- Indian\\nPerforming Rights Society Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPRS’)\\npraying, inter alia, for the following reliefs: -\\n“a) A declaration that the defendant and/or its\\nmembers have no right to issue licences or claim\\npayment of licence fees in relation to the broadcasting of\\nworks embodied in sound recordings administered by\\nPPL and other music companies;\\nb) Declaration that the defendant and/or its\\nmembers have no copyright in respect of any work\\ncomprising of and/or underlying the sound recordings in\\nrelation to which licences are granted by phonographic\\nperformance Ltd. and other music companies;\\nc) Declaration that the plaintiff is not obliged to\\nobtain licence from the defendant or to make payment of\\nany fees to the defendant in relation to works broadcast\\nby the plaintiff;d) Declaration that the threats made by the\\ndefendant to the representatives of the plaintiff is\\nwrongful;\\ne) Declaration that the plaintiff is not and will not be\\ninfringing any legal right of the defendant;\\nf) A Decree of perpetual injunction restraining the\\ndefendant and/or its members from making any\\nwrongful threats or initiating proceedings against the\\nplaintiffs;\\ng) A Decree of perpetual injunction restraining the\\ndefendant and/or its members from in any way or\\nmanner claiming any payment from the plaintiff for the\\nproposed broadcasting of sound recordings administered\\nby Phonographic Performance Ltd. and other recording\\ncompanies;\\nh) A Decree of permanent injunction restraining the\\ndefendant and/or its members, servants, agents and/or\\nassigns from initiating any proceeding against the\\nplaintiff and/or its officers in relation to the matters\\nwhich are the subject matter of the instant suit;”(ii) RTB also prayed for leave under Order 1 Rule 8 of the\\nCode of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Clause 12 of the Letters Patent.\\n(iii) The case made out by RTB in its plaint was that it had\\nincurred substantial expenditure of around Rs. 30.5 crores towards\\nsetting up of radio stations in seven cities, including Kolkata. The\\nradio stations, according to RTB, had been set up and broadcast is to\\ncommence.\\n(iv) RTB has contended that IPRS, being a copyright society\\nregistered under section 33 of the Copyright Act, 1957, was claiming\\nthat it had exclusive right to grant licence on behalf of lyricists,\\ncomposers, etc. and without such licence sound recordings cannot\\nbe broadcast by any radio station and on that basis it had been\\nissuing threats to companies owing radio stations intending to\\ncommence their business of broadcasting.\\n(v) It was on this factual backdrop that the plaintiff\\ninstituted the instant suit for the principal prayers, as quoted above.\\n(vi) Pursuant to grant of leave to the plaintiff-RTB under\\nOrder 1 Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and afteradvertisement, six companies were added as parties to the suit and\\nthey are also respondents in the instant appeal.\\n(vii) At the time of moving the interlocutory application ex\\nparte, for grant of injunction the plaintiff- RTB, inter alia, contended\\nas follows: -\\n“ If notice of the instant application be given the\\nrespondent and its officers will take wrongful steps to act\\nin furtherance of their threats and otherwise act to the\\ndetriment of the petitioner and other persons who have\\nbeen granted licences to make broadcast. Your\\npetitioner have came to learn on 8th April, 2006 that the\\nrespondent is taking steps to file proceedings against the\\npetitioner and its officers in an attempt to harass and\\npressurize them into acceding to the wrongful and\\nunjust demands of the respondent. Accordingly, there is\\ngreat urgency in the matter.”\\n(viii) The respondent, IPRS, however, intervened through\\nCounsel and on 12th April, 2006 the following order was passed by\\nthe Hon’ble First Court: -\\n“THE COURT: This application is being moved by\\nMr. Banerjee with the leave of this Court and in course of\\nhearing Mr. P.C.Sen, learned Senior Advocate instructed\\nby Mr. Firoze Edulji, learned Advocate appears on behalfof the defendant and submits that his client has not taken\\nany legal action pursuant to the threat given. Therefore,\\nhe assures this Court his client will not initiate or cause to\\nbe initiated any criminal proceeding against the petitioner\\ntill 20th April, 2006. The matter will appear as a “New\\nMotion” on 19th April, 2006.\\nThis order is passed without prejudice to the rights\\nand contentions of the parties.\\nAll parties are to act on a signed xerox copy of this\\norder on the usual undertaking.”\\n(ix) Subsequently, a suit, being C.S. No. 632 of 2006, was\\nfiled before the Delhi High Court by IPRS against the plaintiff- RTB,\\ninter alia, claiming for damages for infringement of its copyright. In\\nthe said suit an interlocutory application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2\\nof the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was also filed, wherein IPRS\\ninter alia prayed for an injunction restraining RTB from commencing\\nand/or causing broadcast to be made without obtaining a licence\\nfrom it.\\n(x) Before the Delhi High Court it was contended on behalf\\nof RTB that in so far as broadcasting was concerned, licence was yet\\nto be issued by the Government of India, though the letter of intent\\nhad been issued in January, 2006 and the formalities to becompleted before the broadcast started would take about four\\nmonths. It was further contended by RTB that there was immediate\\nthreat for which interim order would be required and in case it\\nproposed to start broadcasting an advance intimation of at least\\nfifteen (15) days would be given to the court with intimation to the\\nplaintiff (IPRS) so that consideration of the interlocutory application\\ncould be taken up expeditiously in that eventuality. Based on the\\nabove submission of RTB, the Delhi High Court on 18th April, 2006\\ndid not pass any interim order in respect of the interlocutory\\napplication filed by IPRS.\\n(xi) The Hon’ble First Court while passing the order\\nimpugned dismissing RTB’s interlocutory application referred to the\\njudgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Indian\\nPerforming Rights Society –vs- Eastern India Motion Picture\\nAssociation and Ors. reported in AIR 1977 SC 1443 and taking\\ninto consideration the proviso to section 60 of the Copyright Act,\\n1957, was of the prima facie view that IPRS was entitled to claim\\nroyalty and were legitimately entitled to threaten RTB on its refusal\\nto pay such royalty and were also entitled to initiate proceeding by\\ntaking recourse to process of law to protect the interest of their\\nmembers.3. At the time of hearing of the appeal, the learned senior counsel\\nappearing on behalf of the appellant, took us to the facts of the case in detail and\\nsubmitted that the Hon’ble First Court, despite noticing the law laid down by the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court in the Indian Performing Rights Society’s case (supra)\\nthat a composer can claim copyright in his work only if there is an express\\nagreement between him and the owner of the film preserving his right, held in the\\norder impugned that IPRS was entitled to royalty from broadcasters unless it was\\nshown that its members’ rights, were expressly assigned in favour of members of\\nPhonographic Performance Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘PPL’). According to\\nthe learned senior counsel for the appellant, this was wholly contrary to the\\njudgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court referred (supra) as well as the\\njudgement of this High Court, in the case of Eastern India Motion Pictures and\\nOthers –vs- Performing Right Society Ltd. and Others reported in AIR 1978\\nCAL 477. Referring to the paragraphs 17 and 18 of the plaint, learned senior\\ncounsel for the appellant submitted that the Hon’ble First Court had been\\nfactually incorrect to observe that it was not the plaintiff’s case that the members\\nof the IPRS did assign their rights to the producers. The learned senior counsel\\nfor the appellant submitted that the specific case of the plaintiff- RTB was that\\nthe lyricists and composers have no right over the music or lyrics as the same\\nvest in the music producers and/or recording companies and the Hon’ble First\\nCourt had failed to notice the case made out by the plaintiff- RTB.4. It was further submitted by the learned senior counsel for the\\nappellant that the respondent IPRS and its members did not have any copyright\\nin sound recording in law and in the absence of any right in law over sound\\nrecordings generally, it could not claim royalty in respect of all sound recordings\\nintended to be broadcast. Relying further on the judgement of the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court in Indian Performing Rights Society’s case (supra), he\\nsubmitted that the respondent and/or its members can have a right in some\\nworks, only if the same had been specifically reserved in relation to individual\\nsongs/works under agreements entered into by them. He submitted that in the\\ninstant case, no such agreement had been disclosed, hence the respondent IPRS\\nhad failed to disclose that they had retained rights over any works embodied in\\nspecific sound recordings.\\n5. Learned senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that even\\nassuming that the lyricists and composers had have preserved their rights by\\nagreement, the same would, at the highest, be restricted to “public performance\\nrights” in relation to which no royalty could be claimed from radio stations as\\nthey are not involved in any “public performance”. Referring to sections 2(q) and\\n2(qq) of the Copyright Act, 1957, he submitted that “public performance” would\\noccur only in cases of ‘live’ performance and ‘broadcast’ was not a ‘public\\nperformance’.6. He also submitted that since the rights of the lyricists and composers\\nhave vested in the producers, who in turn have authorized the sound recording\\ncompanies to make sound recordings and publish the same, obtaining licence\\nfrom PPL (which represents the sound recording companies) or the sound\\nrecording company themselves, where they are not members of PPL, would be\\nsufficient for the purpose of broadcast of sound recordings.\\n7. Relying on the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Indian\\nPerforming Rights Society’s case (supra) and the two Division Bench\\njudgements of this Court in the case of Eastern India Motion Picture\\nAssociation and Others –vs- Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. and\\nOthers reported in AIR 1974 Cal 257 and Eastern India Motion Pictures &\\nOthers –vs- Performing Right Society Ltd. reported in AIR 1978 Cal 477 he\\nfurther submitted that it was legally settled that lyricists, composers, and\\naccordingly their association, IPRS, have no copyright on the basis of which any\\nclaim could be made against any radio station broadcasting sound recordings.\\n8. Referring to the Delhi High Court suit, the learned senior counsel for\\nthe appellant, submitted that IPRS has, in fact, admitted in that suit that PPL\\nwas a registered copyright society under section 33 of the Copyright Act, 1957, in\\nrespect of sound recordings and the members of PPL have exclusive right to grant\\nlicence, inter alia, for communicating sound recordings to the public, and hence\\nIPRS could not have any right to restrain broadcast of sound recordings.9. Relying again on the judgements referred supra, the learned senior\\ncounsel for the appellant submitted that it was clear that the lyricists’ and\\ncomposers’ rights, if any, could be preserved only by a specific agreement or\\ncontract to the contrary and this question could not be gone into, in the absence\\nof proper materials. He submitted that in the present case no agreement or\\ncontract of any nature was disclosed, either before the Hon’ble First Court or\\nbefore us. He, thus, submitted that IPRS could not claim any right on a factual\\nbasis either, more particularly so, as whether or not there was any agreement to\\nthe contrary, would only be within the special knowledge of IPRS or its members.\\n10. The learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that, in the\\nfacts and circumstances of the instant case, a fortiori, quia timet action would be\\nmaintainable and a person must be held to have access to justice, if his right in\\nany manner, whether to carry on business is infringed upon, or there is a future\\nthreat to such liberty which he enjoys. In this regard he relied on the judgement\\nof the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Tashi Delek Gaming Solutions Ltd.\\nand Anr. –vs- State of Karnataka and Ors. reported in (2006) 1 SCC 442 and\\nthe case of Copyright Agency Ltd. and Others –vs- Haines and Anr. reported in\\n1982 Fleet Street Reports 331. He has further referred to a single bench\\ndecision of the Delhi High Court in the case of Suraj Industries and Others –vs-\\nManek Industries and Others reported in 1991 Patents And Trade Marks\\nCases 141 and submitted that RTB’s suit was a prior suit and the latter suit inDelhi High Court instituted by IPRS was liable to be stayed under section 10 of\\nthe Code of Civil Procedure. He has also relied on the order of the Copyright\\nBoard at Hydrabad in the case of Music Broadcast Private Ltd. and Others –vs-\\nPhonographic Performance Ltd. reported in (2003) 26 Patents And Trade\\nMarks Cases 70 (CB) and submitted that licence for broadcasting sound\\nrecordings administered by PPL was granted automatically pursuant to the said\\norder and after procedural requirement being complied with. He, thus,\\nsubmitted that the fact that RTB did not have a licence from PPL was immaterial.\\n11. On the basis of the above submissions, learned senior counsel for\\nthe appellant prayed that the instant appeal be allowed and the judgement and\\norder of the Hon’ble First Court be set aside.\\n12. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents no. 3, 4\\nand 5, being the added defendants in the suit, essentially adopted the\\nsubmissions made on behalf of the appellant. He has stated that the said\\nrespondents were carrying on business, inter alia, of broadcasting and operating\\nFM radio stations in Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi respectively. After having come\\nto learn of the instant suit filed by RTB with prior leave under Order 1 Rule 8 of\\nthe Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and having similar interest, an application was\\nmade to intervene in the suit and for orders of injunction against IPRS.\\nAccording to the learned counsel, by an order dated 26th April, 2006, the petition\\nof the added respondents were allowed to the extent of orders in terms of prayers(a) and (b) and the added defendants were directed to pay royalty as per the\\nprescribed rate, without prejudice to their rights and contentions. It was\\nsubmitted by the learned counsel for the respondents no. 3, 4 and 5 that the\\norder of the Hon’ble First Court was liable to be set aside for the same reasons,\\nas have been submitted on behalf of the appellant.\\n13. On the other hand, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\\nrespondent IPRS, submitted that the question which is germane for consideration\\nin the instant appeal is whether the appellant has any legal right whatsoever in\\naid of its prayer for interlocutory injunction. Having relied on the facts of the\\ncase, he submitted that the plaintiff has filed the present suit alleging that IPRS\\nwas giving threats and such threats were wrongful threats within the meaning of\\nSection 60 of the Copyright Act, 1957. He has further contended that the\\nrespondent IPRS having filed a suit before the Delhi High Court, inter alia,\\nclaiming for damages for infringement of its copyright, the present suit filed by\\nRTB invoking section 60 of the Copyright Act, 1957, has become infructuous. In\\nthis regard, he has relied on a single bench judgement of the Bombay High Court\\nin the case of Music India Ltd. –vs- M/s Super Cassettes Industrial Pvt. Ltd.\\nand others reported in 1987 Patents And Trade Marks Cases 83.\\n14. He has submitted that RTB approached the Hon’ble First Court on\\nthe basis of pleadings that it had obtained a licence from the Government of\\nIndia to set up a radio station and had to commence broadcasting within a time-frame, failing which its licence would be cancelled. However, before the Delhi\\nHigh Court, RTB, as defendant, had submitted that it had not yet obtained any\\nlicence and it would give intimation of fifteen days prior to broadcast. Learned\\nsenior counsel for the respondent IPRS, thus, submitted that the plaintiff-RTB\\nhad no legal right and as such not entitled to the reliefs sought for.\\n15. Learned senior counsel for the respondent IPRS further submitted\\nthat the instant suit was filed on April, 2006 and, till date, the plaintiff -RTB was\\nneither broadcasting nor had it given any intimation to the Delhi High Court in\\nthe meanwhile as to when it would commence broadcasting. He further\\nsubmitted that RTB had no right to file the present suit and it was premature\\nand speculative in nature. He also submitted that RTB, before the Hon’ble First\\nCourt, had stated on affidavit that it stood threatened by IPRS and on the other\\nhand, in the suit filed by IPRS before the Delhi High Court, RTB, as defendant,\\nsubmitted that there was no threat. According to the learned senior counsel for\\nthe respondent IPRS, the plaintiff- RTB, in the instant suit, had sought to play a\\ngross fraud upon this High Court and had mislead it having approached this\\nHigh Court with unclean hands. He has also submitted that IPRS has more than\\n1500 members, including music companies and producers and in terms of\\nsection 17 of the Copyright Act, 1957, unless there is an agreement to the\\ncontrary, the producers and/or sound recording companies, who are also\\nmembers of IPRS, becomes owners of the copyright. This, according to him,\\nhowever, did not mean that the separate copyright in respect of such lyrics ormusical work was subsumed into the sound recording. The producers and/or\\nmusic companies became the owner of literary works and musical works and\\nthey were entitled to collect royalty for such works. According to him, IPRS is a\\nsociety which collects royalty for the public performance and/or communication\\nto the public of literary and musical work. The separate copyrights of the\\nproducers in respect of sound recordings are administered by PPL. In view of\\nsection 13(4) of the Copyright Act, 1957 those separate copyrights are not\\naffected and IPRS is entitled to collect royalty on behalf of its members for the\\nliterary and musical works contained in a song.\\n16. According to the learned senior counsel for the respondent IPRS, the\\nplaintiff- RTB admittedly intends to broadcast songs. He submitted that\\nbroadcast was defined under section 2(dd) of the Copyright Act, 1957, which\\nmeant communication to public. He further submitted that “communication to\\nthe public” was defined under section 2(ff) of the Copyright Act, 1957. Under\\nsection 14 of the Copyright Act, 1957, copyright means to do or to authorize the\\ndoing of the works in respect of a work, or any other substantial part thereof,\\nincluding communicating to public. Therefore, according to him, if the plaintiff-\\nRTB broadcasted any song containing the literary and musical works of IPRS,\\nwithout obtaining a licence, the same would tantamount to infringement of\\ncopyright of the members of IPRS.17. He also submitted that there is no copyright in a “song” per se,\\nbecause a song is not one of the types of work recognized by the Copyright Act,\\n1957. The term, ‘work’ is defined under section 2(y) of the Copyright Act, 1957.\\nAccording to him, the Copyright Act, 1957, specifically section 13(1) therein,\\nidentifies the various classes of works in which copyright subsists. He further\\nsubmitted that this was relevant because section 16 of the Copyright Act, 1957,\\nspecifically provides that shall be no entitlement of copyright in works other than\\nthose provided by the Copyright Act, 1957. Thus, according to him, section 13(1)\\nof the Copyright Act, 1957, mandates that copyright shall subsist in certain\\nclasses of works, namely, “original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works”\\nand “cinematograph films” and “sound recordings”. He also submitted that a\\n“song”, therefore, comprises of a “bundle” of works, namely, “words” or “lyrics”,\\n“music” or “musical compositions”. He, therefore, submitted that when a singer\\nperforms these aforementioned works and the performance is recorded, a sound\\nrecording is created. According to him, lyrics are “literary works”, within the\\nmeaning of section 2(o) of the Copyright Act, 1957, and musical compositions are\\ndefined as “musical works” under section 2(p) of the Copyright Act, 1957.\\nSimilarly, a “sound recording” is defined in section 2(xx) of the Copyright Act,\\n1957.\\n18. Learned senior counsel for the respondent IPRS submitted that\\ncopyright has long since been recognized as bundle of rights. He submitted that\\nthis logic was drawn from the mandate of the Copyright Act, 1957, particularlysection 13(4), which specifically provides that despite incorporation of a work into\\na sound recording or a cinematograph work, the works so incorporated shall not\\nlose their separate copyright. He submitted that the legislative intent is thus\\nclear from the use of the words, “separate copyright”. He also submitted that\\nsection 13(4) of the Copyright Act, 1957, provides that, “the copyright in a\\ncinematograph film or sound recording shall not affect the separate copyright in\\nany work in respect of which or a substantial part of which, the film, or as the\\ncase may be, the sound recording is made”. He, therefore, submitted that this\\nprovision made it clear that separate copyright of literary work and musical are\\nnot subsumed/merged and/or affected in any manner, just because it is a part of\\na sound recording or a cinematograph film. Therefore, according to the learned\\nsenior counsel, the Copyright Act, 1957, envisages protection of separate rights\\nand the same was further evident from section 56 of the said Act.\\n19. He also submitted that IPRS is a copyright society and is registered\\nas such under section 33(3) of the Copyright Act, 1957, and administers right in\\nrespect of musical works and words and any action intended to be sung, spoken\\nor performed with the music. Therefore, according to him, IPRS administers\\nright only in respect of literary works and musical works. He also submitted that\\nthere was another copyright society, namely, the Phonographic Performance Ltd.\\n(PPL) which administers rights only in respect of sound recordings. Therefore,\\naccording to him, the rights administered by IPRS and PPL were distinct and\\nseparate. He further submitted that the contention of the plaintiff –RTB that it isobliged to take licence only from PPL, was thoroughly misconceived. He\\nsubmitted that, in fact, a perusal of the membership list of PPL would show that\\nmany members of PPL were also members of IPRS, having assigned their rights in\\nwords and music to IPRS and rights in sound recordings separately to PPL.\\n20. The learned senior counsel for IPRS submitted that in view of Section\\n13(4) of the Copyright Act, 1957, separate copyright of literary and musical work\\nwere not affected and therefore, IPRS was entitled to law to collect royalty in\\nrespect of literary works and the musical works embodied in a song when the\\nsame was communicated to public.\\n21. The learned senior counsel for the respondent IPRS, in conclusion,\\nsubmitted that the present suit has become infructuous in view of the\\nsubsequent suit filed by IPRS at Delhi High Court and in any event by virtue of\\nRTB’s own admission made before the Delhi High Court that there is no threat,\\nthe instant suit is premature and is liable to be dismissed for lack of cause of\\naction. In the circumstances, he submitted that the instant appeal is also liable\\nto be dismissed.\\n22. After considering the submissions made by the learned senior\\ncounsel appearing on behalf of the parties, we are of the view that in the facts\\nand circumstances of the instant case, what is required to be considered and\\ndecided in the present appeal is whether the plaintiff- RTB, being the appellantherein, has any legal right to be granted an order of injunction, as prayed for,\\nbefore the Hon’ble First Court, in its interlocutory application.\\n23. However, before we venture to do so, we must hasten to state that we\\nintend to confine ourselves only to the aspect of non-grant of interlocutory relief\\nand not go beyond it, since it would tantamount to adjudication of the principal\\nissues of the pending suit itself. We shall, therefore, only take into consideration\\nthe submissions made by the parties before us which, according to us, are\\nrelevant for the purpose of deciding this aspect of the matter alone.\\n24. As it appears RTB, as plaintiff, instituted the instant suit inter alia\\nseeking a declaration that the defendant- IPRS and/or its members do not have\\nany copyright in the sound recording or the works underlying the same and were\\nnot entitled to claim any licence fee or interfere with broadcasting activities of\\nradio stations. Additional relief has also been claimed by the plaintiff- RTB under\\nsection 60 of the Copyright Act, 1957 against groundless threats of initiating\\nlegal proceeding, made by IPRS.\\n25. At this stage, one cannot lose sight of an important development that\\ntook place subsequent to the filing of the instant suit. The defendant -IPRS\\ninstituted a suit against RTB before the Delhi High Court, praying, inter alia, for\\ndamages for infringement of copyright and for a perpetual injunction restraining\\ninfringement of the plaintiff’s (IPRS’s) copyright. An interlocutory application wasalso taken out therein by the plaintiff (IPRS) under order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read\\nwith section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.\\n26. The contention of the plaintiff/appellant- RTB, elaborately dwells\\nupon the various provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957 and it has been\\ncontended, inter alia, that IPRS and its members do not have any copyright in\\nsound recording in law and that in the absence of any right in law over sound\\nrecordings generally, IPRS cannot claim royalty in all sound recordings intended\\nto be broadcast. In this regard, reliance has been placed on the judgement of the\\nHon’ble Supreme Court in the Indian Performing Rights Society’s case (supra).\\nThe Hon’ble Supreme Court in Indian Performing Rights Society’s case was\\nconsidering, inter alia, whether in view of the provisions of the Copyright Act,\\n1957, an existing and future right of a music composer, lyricist was capable of\\nassignment and whether the producer of a cinematograph film could defeat the\\nsame by engaging the same person.\\n27. The other decision relied upon by the appellant in the case of\\nEastern India Motion Picture Association and Others –vs- Indian Performing\\nRights Society Ltd. and Others reported in AIR 1974 Cal 257 has been\\nconsidered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the judgement referred supra and,\\nas such, we do not propose to deal with it separately. Similarly, the other\\njudgement relied on by the appellant in the case of Eastern India Motion\\nPictures and Others –vs- Performing Right Society Ltd. and Others reportedin AIR 1978 CAL 477 takes into consideration and relies on the aforementioned\\njudgement of the Supreme Court.\\n28. So far as the merits of the respective contentions of the parties with\\nregard to the applicability of the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\\nIndian Performing Rights Society’s case (supra) is concerned, we do not wish\\nto express any opinion, since if we do so, it would tantamount to adjudication of\\nthe principal prayers of the suit itself, at the interlocutory stage.\\n29. From a bare perusal of the reliefs as prayed for in the instant suit, it\\nappears to us that the instant suit is not a suit simplicitor under section 60 of\\nthe Copyright Act, 1957, against IPRS. In fact, the principal reliefs include\\nseeking a declaration that IPRS and/or its members do not have any copyright in\\nthe sound recordings or the works underlying the same and are not entitled to\\nany licence fees or interfere with broadcasting activities of radio stations.\\nAlthough we are not willing to express our opinion as to whether the suit before\\nthe Delhi High Court instituted by IPRS is liable to be stayed, as submitted by\\nthe learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, relying on Suraj\\nIndustries and Others –vs- Manek Industries and Others reported in 1991\\nPatents And Trade Marks Cases 141, we are, at the same time, unable to\\naccept the submission of the respondent IPRS, relying on Music India Ltd. –vs-\\nSuper Cassettes reported in 1987 Patents And Trade Marks Cases 83, that the\\ninstant suit has become infructuous since action under section 60 of theCopyright Act, 1957 cannot be maintainable any more consequent to the filing of\\nthe suit at Delhi High Court, in view of our preceding discussion.\\n30. We are thus unable to accept the submission made in this regard on\\nbehalf of the respondent IPRS that the present suit for groundless legal threat\\nhas become infructuous because of the institution of the subsequent suit by\\nIPRS against RTB before the Delhi High Court. The respondent IPRS was, in fact,\\nconscious of the fact that RTB instituted the present suit before this High Court,\\ninter alia, praying for relief under section 60 of the Copyright Act, 1957 and it\\nwas a deliberate action on the part of IPRS to institute the subsequent suit\\nagainst RTB at Delhi High Court, soon thereafter.\\n31. So far as the judgement of the Copyright Board in the case of Music\\nBroadcast Private Ltd. and Others –vs- Phonographic Performance Ltd.\\nreported in 2003(26) Patents And Trade Marks Cases 70(CB), relied on by the\\nlearned senior counsel for the appellant with regard to issue of licence for\\nbroadcasting sound recording administered by PPL, we do not consider it\\nnecessary to take any notice thereof in view of the scope within which we have\\nconfined ourselves in so far as the instant appeal is concerned.\\n32. In the instant case, however, it appears that the appellant seeks to\\nmaintain a quia timet action relying on section 60 of the Copyright Act 1957.\\nSection 60 of the Copyright Act is reproduced hereinbelow: -“60. Remedy in the case of groundless threat of legal\\nproceedings. - Where any person claiming to be the owner of\\ncopyright in any work, by circulars, advertisements or otherwise,\\nthreatens any other person with any legal proceedings or liability in\\nrespect of an alleged infringement of the copyright, any person\\naggrieved thereby may, notwithstanding anything contained in\\nsection 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (47 of 1963), institute a\\ndeclaratory suit that the alleged infringement to which the threats\\nrelated was not in fact an infringement of any legal rights of the\\nperson making such threats and may in any such suit-\\n(a) obtain an injunction against the continuance of\\nsuch threats; and\\n(b) recover such damages, if any, as he has sustained\\nby reason of such threats:\\nProvided that this section does not apply if the person making\\nsuch threats, with due diligence, commences and prosecutes an\\naction for infringement of the copyright claimed by him.”\\n33. The definition of quia timet appearing in Black’s Law Dictionary, 8th\\nEdition, is as follows: -\\n“quia timet- A legal doctrine that allows a person to seek\\nequitable relief from future probable harm to a specific right or\\ninterest.”34. The judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Tashi\\nDelek Gaming Solutions Ltd. and Anr. –vs- State of Karnatake & Ors.\\nreported in 2006(1)SCC 442 recognizes that a fortiori, a quia timet application\\nwould be maintainable and the person must be held to have access to justice if\\nhis right in any manner, whether to carry on business is infringed upon or there\\nis a future threat to his liberty.\\n35. The appellant has also relied on the decision rendered by the Hon’ble\\nSupreme Court of New South Wales: Equity Division in the case of Copyright\\nAgency Ltd. and Ors. –vs- Haines and Anr. reported in 1982 Fleet Street\\nReports 331 with regard to the criteria of probability of apprehended injury to be\\nconsidered by a Court while granting quia timet relief.\\n36. In the instant case it appears that it has been submitted by RTB\\nbefore the Delhi High Court that a licence is yet to be issued by the Government\\nand there was no immediate threat for which interim order would be required.\\nBased, inter alia, on this submission of RTB, the Delhi High Court refused to\\ngrant an interim order in favour of IPRS. In the order of the Delhi High Court,\\nthe pending proceeding before this Court has also been noticed. In our opinion,\\nthe action of the defendant in the present suit, i.e., IPRS, instituting the latter\\nsuit at Delhi High Court is a clear indication that they have initiated legal action\\nagainst the appellant herein.37. However, in respect of the prima facie observation made by the\\nHon’ble First Court in the order impugned that IPRS was entitled to claim royalty\\nfrom RTB, we are of the opinion that the same need not have been made since\\nwhether or not IPRS is legitimately entitled to demand royalty from RTB is an\\nissue which will arise only at the time of commencement of broadcast by RTB,\\nwhich, admittedly, has not yet commenced and the parties will have the liberty\\nthen to approach the Hon’ble First Court for appropriate orders.\\n38. We are also of the opinion that in view of the subsequent suit filed\\nbefore the Delhi High Court by IPRS, a quia timet relief based on the provision of\\nsection 60 of the Copyright Act, 1957, may not be germane any more. However,\\nit appears that section 60 falls under Chapter XII of the Copyright Act, 1957,\\nwhich deals with civil remedies. It is, therefore, required to be examined as to\\nwhether a quia timet relief can be granted to the plaintiff/appellant- RTB beyond\\nthe scope of section 60, which falls under Chapter XII of the Copyright Act, 1957.\\n39. As discussed before, the definition of quia timet, borrowed from\\nBlack’s, means a legal doctrine that allows a person to seek equitable relief from\\nfuture probable harm to a specific right or interest. Therefore, such equitable\\nrelief can be granted to a person, provided he can successfully demonstrate\\nbefore a Court that his fears in this regard are not unfounded.40. While we are convinced that a quia timet relief can be granted in\\nfavour of the appellant, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the\\ninstant case as discussed in detail above, we are also of the opinion that the\\nsame ought not to be in the nature of a relief which, if granted, would, in effect,\\nallow the present suit itself, at the interlocutory stage. Therefore, although it\\nmay not be open to the plaintiff/appellant to invoke section 60 of the Copyright\\nAct, 1957, and seek quia timet relief as contemplated under that provision of law,\\nconsequent to filing of the subsequent suit at Delhi High Court by IPRS, we are\\nnevertheless of the prima facie opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the\\ninstant case, as discussed above, the appellant is entitled to a quia timet relief in\\nthe nature of an injunction restraining the respondent IPRS from initiating any\\nproceeding against the plaintiff as well as the added defendants, under Chapter\\nXIII of the Copyright Act, 1957, until disposal of the present suit. The impugned\\njudgement and order stands modified accordingly.\\n(BISWANATH SOMADDER, J.)\\nI agree.\\n(PINAKI CHANDRA GHOSE, J.)',\n",

Heard Sri.Blaze K. Jose, learned counsel appearing for the\\npetitioner, Sri.S. Manu, learned Deputy Solicitor General of India,\\ninstructed by Sri.Suvin R. Menon, learned Central Government Counsel2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 2\\n(CGC), appearing for R-1 & R-2 and Sri.Ashok M.

In the nature of the orders proposed to be\\npassed by this Court in this writ proceedings, notices to official\\nrespondents 6 to 8 (authorities of the State of Tamil Nadu), will\\nstand dispensed with.\\n3. The petitioner claims that he is the Chief Coordinator\\nof a charitable society, by name Twenty–20 Association,\\nKizhakkambalam and is also the President of the Twenty–20 Party,\\nwhich is stated to be a registered political party with the Election\\nCommission of India, and that he is also the Managing Director of\\none of the leading private industrial establishments in the State,\\nnamely \\'Kitex Garments Ltd.\\', which is stated to be the largest private\\nemployer in the State of Kerala, situated in Kizhakkambalam.\\n4. The petitioner would state that this Court, in a suo moto\\npublic interest litigation proceedings in W.P.(C) No.13204/2021, had\\npassed order dated 23.03.2023, preventing the capture of a wild\\ntusker, popularly known as ‘Arikomban’ (hereinafter referred for\\nshort as the \\'wild tusker\\' or \\'wild elephant\\') from Chinnakkanal area,2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 3\\nMunnar, Idukki District, and had constituted an Expert Committee,\\nin that regard. Further, it is averred that after considering the report\\nof the said Committee, this Court had passed an order dated\\n05.04.2023, ordering that the said Expert Committee has considered\\nall relevant aspects and has come to the conclusion that the best\\npossible way to deal with the present situation is only to capture,\\nradio-collar and translocate the wild tusker to Parambikulam Tiger\\nReserve, Palakkad District, within the limits of the State of Kerala\\nand that this could be the best option.\\n5. Further that, there were serious objections from the\\npeople of the locality in Parambikulam, Palakkad District, Kerala\\nState, and therefore, this Court had passed an order dated\\n19.04.2023 in the above public interest litigation proceedings,\\ndirecting that any alternative site that may be suggested by the\\nGovernment of the State of Kerala for translocating the wild\\nelephant, which has caused problems in Chinnakkanal area, shall be\\nsubmitted in a sealed cover to the Expert Committee, constituted by\\nthe Court as per order dated 29.03.2023. It was further ordered\\ntherein that the members of the said Committee shall examine the\\nfeasibility and shall ensure that the details of the alternate site are2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 4\\nkept confidential, awaiting further orders from this Court. Further\\nthat, if the Committee approves the alternate site, then the capture\\nand shifting of the wild tusker, in terms of the earlier orders issued\\nby this Court in the public interest litigation proceedings, to the said\\nalternate site, need not await further orders from this Court. Further\\nthat, on 30.04.2023, the wild elephant in question was tranquilized,\\ncaptured, radio-collared and shifted to the Periyar Tiger Reserve,\\nIdukki District, within the territorial limits of the State of Kerala.\\nFurther, it is averred that the learned Additional Advocate General\\nhas placed before the court a report/note on the capture and\\ntranslocation of the afore wild elephant. Further, it is averred that,\\non 27.05.2023, the wild tusker had again entered the areas of human\\ninhabitation within the limits of the State of Tamil Nadu, especially\\nin Cumbam town. That, three people were reportedly injured while\\ntrying to escape after seeing the elephant and one of them had\\nsustained serious injuries. Further, even according to the words used\\nby the petitioner ‘the rogue elephant’ [see the top portion of synopsis\\non page 2 of the W.P.(C) and para No.16 on page 9 of the W.P.(C).],\\nhad damaged several vehicles parked in Cumbam town in Tamil\\nNadu. Further, it is averred that, while the wild tusker entered the2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 5\\ndensely populated area, the 7th respondent-Principal Chief\\nConservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden of the State of\\nTamil Nadu, has issued Ext.P1 proceedings No.WL1/14072/2023\\ndated 27.05.2023, wherein it has been ordered to tranquilize and\\ncapture the elelphant and to translocate and release the wild tusker\\nin the deep forest area of Vellaimalai in Varashanadu Valley of\\nMegamalai Forest Division of the State of Tamil Nadu, in terms of\\nthe provisions contained in Sec.11 and Sec.48A of the Wildlife\\n(Protection) Act, 1972, etc.\\n6. The gist of the grounds urged by the petitioner are to the\\neffect that Sec.11 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, gives\\nparamount importance to the welfare of wildlife animals and the\\nmethods and course to be adopted is drafted in a meticulous way to\\nensure the safety and welfare of the animal. It is urged that the\\nprovisos to Sec.11 and the explanatory notes that follow makes it\\nevident that the process of capture of such animals shall be made in\\nsuch a manner to cause minimum trauma to the said animal.\\nFurther, it is also urged that the visuals on the media would show\\nthat the trunk of the elephant is badly injured and the tusker is weak,\\ndue to non-availability of drinking water, as per the opinion of2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 6\\nexperts and that the animal is in utmost distress and danger, causing\\nserious threat to its own life. It is also urged that releasing the wild\\ntusker in the very same forest range and that too in an area too close\\ncannot be considered as translocation and should be kept in mind\\nthat the animal should be translocated to a forest range that is\\ncompletely disconnected from the home range of the elephant, to\\nensure that the same will not come near the human settlement, etc. It\\nis in the light of these aspects that the petitioner has filed the\\naforecaptioned writ petition (civil) with the aforementioned prayers.\\n7. After hearing the aforesaid parties through their learned\\nAdvocates, and after going through the pleadings and materials on\\nrecord, and also going through the provisions of the relevant\\nprovisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, more particularly Sec.11,\\netc., we specifically queried to the learned counsel appearing for the\\npetitioner as to how the factual averments in the W.P.(C) could\\njustify the grant of any of the prayers in the W.P.(C), more\\nparticularly prayers I, II & III. The first prayer is as follows:-\\n“I. To issue a writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ,\\norder or direction commanding the respondents 1, 2 and 6 to 8 to\\ntake utmost care and caution not to cause any injury or other\\nhealth hazard to the bull tusker Arikomban while using\\ntranquilization and kumki elephants to translocate and\\nrehabilitating the elephant and strictly adhere to the statutory\\nand mandatory protocols, standards and norms under the Wild\\nLife (Protection) Ac, 1972 and the Rules there under.”2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 7\\n8. The specific factual version of the petitioner is that the\\nwild tusker is now not within the territorial limits of the State of\\nKerala but within the territories of the State of Tamil Nadu.\\n9. The entire incidents projected in the writ petition, after\\nthe migration of the elephant, to the limits of the State of Tamil Nadu\\nand the facts in relation to the issuance of Ext.P1 statutory order\\ndated 27.05.2023, issued by the 7th respondent-Chief Wildlife\\nWarden, Tamil Nadu, and the subsequent facts thereto have all\\nhappened within the territorial limits of the State of Tamil Nadu. We\\nspecifically queried to the petitioner as to whether there are any\\nfactual averments in the petition that show that the respondents 6-8\\nand the authorities of the State of Tamil Nadu, have, in any manner,\\nneglected their duties or have caused any unnecessary harm or\\ncruelty to the wild tusker in question. We also queried as to whether\\nthere are any averments that the abovesaid alleged injury on the\\ntrunk of the elephant was, according to the petitioner, caused by the\\nacts of the officials of the Tamil Nadu or due to their gross\\nnegligence.\\n10. We also queried as to whether the petitioner has made\\nout any averments that the respondent-Union Government2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 8\\nauthorities (R-1 & R-2) and the respondent authorities of the State of\\nTamil Nadu (R-6 to R-8), have, in any manner, neglected to do their\\nstatutory duties and obligations, in terms of the provisions contained\\nin the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, or the guidelines issued by the\\nUnion Government in accordance with the said Act. The learned\\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner was unable to show us any\\nfactual pleadings on these crucial aspects. We have also gone through\\nthe pleadings in the W.P.(C) and it is seen that the petitioner has not\\nmade out any factual averments or grounds that, after the migration\\nof the wild tusker to the territories of the State of Tamil Nadu,\\nrespondents 1, 2, 6 to 8 have, in any manner, acted illegally or have\\nabdicated from the statutory duties and responsibilities. Therefore,\\neven if we assume that this writ proceedings is maintainable, as\\nagainst the respondent-authorities of the State of Tamil Nadu, no\\nfactual averments are made out to bring out a cause of action to\\njustify a prayer in the above regard. So also, no legal contentions or\\ngrounds are urged in the W.P.(C). for justifying the grant of prayer\\nNo. I, with the support of the necessary factual averments.\\n11. On the other hand, Ext.P1 order dated 27.05.2023, issued\\nby the 7th respondent-Chief Wildlife Warden, Tamil Nadu, reads as2023:KER:29723\\nW.P.

Sec.11 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, reads as\\nfollows:-\\n“Sec. 11. Hunting of wild animals to be permitted in certain case-\\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time\\nbeing in force and subject to the provisions of Chapter IV,—\\n(a) the Chief Wild Life Warden may, if he is satisfied that any wild\\nanimal specified in Schedule I has become dangerous to human life or is\\nso disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, by Order in writing\\nand stating the reasons therefor, permit any person to hunt such animal\\nor cause such animal to be hunted;\\nProvided that no wild animal shall be ordered to be killed unless the\\nChief Wild Life Warden is satisfied that such animal cannot be captured,\\ntranquilised or translocated:\\nProvided further that no such captured animal shall be kept in\\ncaptivity unless the Chief Wild Life Warden is satisfied that such animal\\ncannot be rehabilitated in the wild and the reasons for the same are\\nrecorded in writing.\\nExplanation.—For the purposes of clause (a), the process of capture or\\ntranslocation, as the case may be, of such animal shall be made in such\\nmanner as to cause minimum trauma to the said animal.\\n(b) the Chief Wild Life Warden or the authorised officer may, if he is\\nsatisfied that any wild animal specified in Schedule II, Schedule III, or\\nSchedule IV, has become dangerous to human life or to property\\n(including standing crops on any land) or is so disabled or diseased as\\nto be beyond recovery, by order in writing and stating the reasons\\ntherefor, permit any person to hunt such animal or group of animals in\\na specified area or cause such animal or group of animals in that\\nspecified area to be hunted.\\n(2) The killing or wounding in good faith of any wild animal in defence of2023:KER:29723\\nW.P.

A reading of the abovesaid provisions of Sec.11 of the\\nWildlife (Protection) Act as well as a reading of the impugned Ext.P1\\norder will make it clear that the 7th respondent-Chief Wildlife\\nWarden, who is the sole statutory authority conferred with the\\nstatutory jurisdiction in terms of Sec.11, has exercised his discretion\\nand has also ordered the constitution of an Expert Committee to\\nassist him in the implementation of the decision and the various\\ndetails of the ways and means for implementing the said order is also\\nmeticulously dealt with therein. Ultimately, the 7th respondent-Chief\\nWildlife Warden of the State of Tamil Nadu, who is the statutory\\nauthority, has ordered that the wild tusker, after capture, shall be\\ntranslocated and released in the deep forest areas of the forest range\\nof the forest division concerned of the State of Tamil Nadu, etc. We\\nspecifically queried to Sri.Blaze K. Jose, learned counsel appearing\\nfor the petitioner, as to how he can make out a case that Ext.P1 is\\nillegal or ultra vires to the provisions contained in Sec.11. Further,\\neven according to the version of the petitioner, as can be seen from2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 12\\nhis pleadings as well as ground V, Sec.11 gives the Chief Wildlife\\nWarden, who is the statutory authority, to take recourse to three\\noptions-(i) hunt/kill (ii) translocate and rehabilitate the animal to\\nthe wild (iii) keep the animal in captivity. It is specifically asserted by\\nthe counsel for the petitioner that the capture and translocation of\\nthe wild animal to an alternate forest and rehabilitaion of the same,\\ncould be the first method that should be adopted. A reading of the\\nprovisos to Sec.11(1)(a) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act would make it\\nclear that translocation to the wild of the wild animal is the preferred\\noption. In this regard, the learned Addl. Advocate General and the\\nlearned Dy. Solicitor General of India have pointed out that that, as\\nper the statutory provisions contained in Sec. 11, more particularly\\nSec.11(1)(a) and its two provisos, the statutory authority is\\nempowered, as per the second proviso, to order for captivity of the\\nwild animal, in lieu of translocation, if the said authority is satisfied\\nthat such animal cannot be rehabilitated in the wild and the reasons\\nfor the same are recorded in writing.\\n14. Further, it is also contended by the petitioner, in para 10\\non page 8 of the Writ Petition, that while effecting translocation\\nmode, it is pertinent to keep in mind that releasing the wild animal in2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 13\\nthe same forest range and that too, in an area too close, could not be\\ntermed as translocation and it has to be kept in mind that the animal\\nshould be translocated to a forest range that is completely\\ndisconnected from the home range of the elephant, to ensure that the\\nsame will not come near the human settlement. In that regard, it has\\nto be borne in mind that the petitioner has no factual case that the\\nhome area of the wild elephant is very close to the deep forest areas\\nof Vellaimalai in Varashanadu Valley of Megamalai division, to which\\narea translocation has been ordered or that the deep forest area of\\nVellaimalai is very close to human habitation. Hence, such\\ncontentions of the petitioner cannot be countenanced.\\n15. Further, the petitioner even critiques the earlier translocation\\nof the wild tusker to Periyar tiger Reserve, which he claims is a\\nnearby forest area and that the said measure did not fetch any\\nmeaningful solution, etc. Essentially, the petitioner is critiquing the\\ntranslocation effected to Periyar Tiger Reserve, which was done\\npursuant to the orders of this Court in the previous litigative\\nproceedings. It has to be borne in mind that the present incidents,\\nwhich led to Ext.P-1, have happened after the migration of the wild\\ntusker to the territorial limits of the State of Tamil Nadu. Hence,2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 14\\nthere is no necessity for us to deal with the criticism made by the\\npetitioner as regards the previous translocation effected within the\\nState of Kerala.\\n16. In the instant case, the 7th respondent has ordered for,\\nnot merely the capture of the wild animal after tranquilisation, but\\nthereafter, to translocate the wild tusker to the deeper forest areas of\\nthe forest division concerned of the State of Tamil Nadu.\\n17. So, a reading of Ext.P1 will make it clear that the decision\\ntaken by the 7th respondent, in terms of Ext.P1, appears to be\\nintravires and cannot be said to be illegal or against the provisions of\\nSec.11 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.\\n18. So also, there are no factual averments that the statutory and\\nmandatory protocols and standards under the Wildlife Protection\\nAct, 1972 and Rules and norms made thereunder has, in any manner,\\nbeen violated by the 7th respondent (Chief Wildlife Warden of the\\nState of Tamil Nadu) or any of the other officials concerned. Hence,\\nwe are not in a position to grant prayer No. I.\\n19. Further, it is also to be noted that the petitioner has not\\nchosen to challenge the legality and vires of Ext.P-1 order, and there\\nis no prayer for quashment of Ext.P-1.2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 15\\n20. Prayer No. II of the W.P(C) reads as follows :\\n“II. Issue a writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or\\ndirection commanding the respondents to translocate and\\nrehabilitate the bull tusker Arikomban to an alternate deep forest\\nrange that is completely disconnected from the home range by\\nusing scientific methods causing minimum trauma to the said\\nanimal in the event of tranquilizing the (sic) and capturing the\\nsame.”\\n21. As indicated above, the specific decision of the 7th\\nrespondent (Chief Wildlife Warden) is to capture and then\\ntranslocate the wild tusker to the deeper forest areas of the Forest\\nDivision of the State of Tamil Nadu. The petitioner has no case that\\nthe action in that regard has been done by causing any unnecessary\\ntrauma or cruelty to the said animal by respondents 6 to 8. There is\\nalready a decision taken by the said respondent, in terms of Ext.P-1,\\nto translocate the wild tusker to the wild premises of the forest\\ndivision concerned of the State of Tamil Nadu. Hence, for all these\\nreasons, there is no necessity for us to entertain and grant prayer\\nNo.II.\\n22. Prayer No.III reads as follows :\\n“III. Issue a writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or\\ndirection commanding the respondents 6 to 8 handover bull tusker\\nArikomban to respondents 3 to 5 and to translocate and\\nrehabilitate the same in any of the forest divisions in Kerala.”\\n23. At the outset, it has to be noted that the petitioner has not\\nsought any prayer for quashment of Ext.P-1 order. Further, there are\\nno factual averments or legal grounds in support of such factual2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 16\\naverments that Ext.P-1 is illegal and ultra vires and that it is to be\\nquashed. The plea made in prayer No.III is that this Court, in\\nexercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,\\nby taking resort to this PIL proceedings, should issue a mandamus to\\ndirect respondents 6 to 8 (State of Tamil Nadu represented by the\\nChief Secretary, Principle CCF & Chief Wildlife Warden, Tamil Nadu\\nand the Chief Conservator of Forest & Field Director concerned, etc.),\\nto hand over the aforesaid wild tusker to respondents 3 to 5\\n(authorities of the State of Kerala) and to translocate and rehabilitate\\nthe said elephant in any of the forest divisions of Kerala. At the\\noutset, it has to be noted that there are no averments in the W.P.(C)\\nthat the wild tusker should necessarily be brought back from the\\nState of Tamil Nadu to the State of Kerala and that the authorities of\\nthe State of Kerala should translocate and rehabilitate in some other\\nForest division in the State of Kerala. That apart, no grounds are\\nurged in the W.P(C) in support of any such plea, even if it is assumed\\nfor a moment that such factual averment has been made.\\n24. We specifically queried to Sri.Blaze K Jose, learned counsel\\nappearing for the petitioner, as to the rationale and justification for\\nprayer No.III. The petitioner claims to be not only a public spirited2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 17\\nperson, but also is stated to be one of the leading industrialists in the\\nState of Kerala and is also the President of a political party registered\\nwith the Election Commission of India. We specifically queried as to\\nwhat public interest would be subserved by compelling the\\nrespondent (Tamil Nadu authorities) to bring back the wild tusker to\\nthe State of Kerala and to direct the State authorities of the State of\\nKerala to translocate it to some other forest regions in the State of\\nKerala. We could not get any satisfactory response from the learned\\ncounsel for the petitioner to our specific queries.\\n25. Further, it is also submitted by the Addl. Advocate General\\nthat the premise taken up by the petitioner, as if the wild tusker in\\nquestion is domiciled to the State of Kerala is highly erroneous and\\nuntenable and is based on a complete misconception of law and that\\na wild animal, which comes within the ambit of the Wildlife\\n(Protection) Act, cannot be attributed with any State-wide domicile\\nor nativity. Further, it is also pointed out that the Apex Court in the\\ndecision in State of Telangana & Anr. v. B.Subba Rayudu &\\nOrs. [AIR 2022 SC 4373, para 59] has observed that even for Indian\\ncitizens, the concept based on State wise domicile is not recognised\\nand that there is only one domicile of the country.2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 18\\n26. It has to be borne in mind that, going by the pleadings and\\nmaterials on record, the 7th respondent (Chief Wildlife Warden of\\nTamil Nadu), who is the statutory authority, in terms of Sec.11, has\\nexercised his discretion in terms of Ext.P-1 and has decided that the\\nwild tusker should be captured and translocated to the deeper forest\\nareas within the State of Tamil Nadu. There is no prayer to quash\\nExt.P-1 decision. In the light of these aspects, we fail to understand\\nas to how the petitioner can make out such a prayer. No rationale is\\nmade out by the petitioner for justifying such a plea. There are no\\nfactual averments or legal grounds made out in that regard. Hence,\\nthere is no question of entertaining and granting prayer No.III.\\n27. Further, we are now apprised that the competent authority\\nof the 1st respondent (Union Government) in the Ministry concerned\\nhas issued detailed norms, issuing human-elephant conflict litigation\\nguidelines. We are also told that it is also reported that the Press\\nInformation Bureau of the Union Government has released the\\nabovesaid guidelines dated 21.03.2023 on the same day in English\\nlanguage and in other vernacular language, including Malayalam\\nlanguage. In this regard, reference is made by them to the provisions\\ncontained in the Human-elephant Conflict Litigation Guidelines2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 19\\ndated 21.3.2023 issued by the 1st respondent Union Government,\\nmore particularly the first and second points appended to Clause 7.3\\nthereof. We specifically queried to the petitioner\\'s counsel, as to\\nwhether the petitioner has perused the said guidelines. We also\\nqueried to the petitioner, as to what exactly is his expertise to venture\\ninto this Public Interest Litigation and to claim that his suggestions\\nare far more superior than the one adopted by the 7th respondent\\n(statutory authority), in terms of Ext.P-1. We could not get any\\nsatisfactory answers in that regard, except that he is a public spirited\\nperson, etc. True that, this Court has passed orders dated\\n23.03.2023, 05.04.2023, etc., in a PIL matter, when there were\\nserious problems created in the State of Kerala. Those factual\\nincidents are over. The present factual incidents, in support of the\\nabovesaid prayers, are all in relation to factual incidents, which has\\nhappened after the migration of the wild tusker to the limits of the\\nState of Tamil Nadu and thereafter.\\n28. Further, it is also pertinent to note the dictum laid down\\nin a very recent verdict, rendered by a Five-Judge Constitution Bench\\nof the Apex Court on 18.05.2023 in the case of Animal Welfare\\nBoard of India & Ors. v. Union of India & anr. [Writ Petition2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 20\\n(Civil) No.23/2016, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 661], wherein it has been\\nheld, in para No.26, of the SCC Online report as follows :\\n“Para 26. On the question of conferring fundamental right on animals\\nwe do not have any precedent. The Division Bench in the case of A.\\nNagaraja [(2014) 7 SCC 547] also does not lay down that animals have\\nFundamental Rights. The only tool available for testing this proposition\\nis interpreting the three Amendment Acts on the anvil of reasonableness\\nin Article 14 of the Constitution of India. While the protection under\\nArticle 21 has been conferred on person as opposed to a citizen, which is\\nthe case in Article 19 of the Constitution, we do not think it will be prudent\\nfor us to venture into a judicial adventurism to bring bulls within the said\\nprotected mechanism. We have our doubt as to whether detaining a stray\\nbull from the street against its wish could give rise to the constitutional\\nwrit of habeas corpus or not. In the judgment of A. Nagaraja (supra),\\nthe question of elevation of the statutory rights of animals to the realm of\\nfundamental rights has been left at the advisory level or has been framed\\nas a judicial suggestion. We do not want to venture beyond that and leave\\nthis exercise to be considered by the appropriate legislative body. We do\\nnot think Article 14 of the Constitution can also be invoked by any animal\\nas a person. While we can test the provisions of an animal welfare\\nlegislation, that would be at the instance of a human being or a juridical\\nperson who may espouse the cause of animal welfare.”\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n29. It has been, inter alia, observed in the afore Constitution\\nBench verdict that, while the protection under Article 21 has been\\nconferred on a person as opposed to a citizen, which is also the case\\nin Article 19 of the Constitution, their Lordships of the Apex Court do\\nnot think it prudent for the Court to venture into a judicial\\nadventurism to bring animals within the said protected mechanism\\nand that, their Lordships have doubt as to whether detaining a stray-\\nbull from the street against its wish, could give rise to a\\nconstitutional writ of habeas corpus or not.\\n30. During the course of the hearing we also queried to2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 21\\nSri.Ashok M. Cherian, learned Additional Advocate General,\\nappearing for the respondent-authorities of the State of Kerala, as to\\nwhat is the stand of the State of Kerala, as regards prayer No.III and\\nas to whether the competent authority of the State of Kerala and the\\nForest department of the State of Kerala wants the wild tusker, which\\nis now ordered to be translocated to the wild recess of the forest of\\nthe State of Tamil Nadu, should be brougt back to the State of Kerala,\\nin order to translocate it to the forest areas of the State of Kerala.\\n31. Sri.Ashok M. Cherian, learned Additional Advocate General,\\nappearing for the respondent-State of Kerala, has submitted that he\\nis instructed at the higher level of the State Government to submit\\nthat the State of Kerala is opposing the said prayer and that the said\\nprayer of the writ petitoner is highly irresponsible, to say the least.\\nWe also queried to the learned Deputy Solicitor General of India as to\\nthe stand of the respondent-Union Government, as to prayer No.III\\nand related aspects. The specific submission made on behalf of the\\nrespondent-Union of India is that the petitioner has not made out any\\ncase of illegality, unreasonableness or impropriety in the issuance of\\nthe well-considered decision taken by the 7th respondent-Chief\\nWildlife Warden, State of Tamil Nadu, in issuing Ext.P1 order and2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 22\\nthat therefore, there is no question of the petitioner in maintaining\\nany of the prayers, including prayer No.III, in the light of the factual\\naverments and contention in this W.P.(C).\\n32. Thus, we fail to comprehend the rationale and justification\\nfor the petitioner for venturing into this litigative proceedings.\\nHaving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we refrain\\nourselves from imposing costs.\\n33. We have proceeded on the above premise to ascertain as to\\nwhether at least a prima facie cogent case is made out in this case,\\neven if it is assumed that this Court can invoke writ jurisdiction\\nagainst respondents 6 to 8 (authorities of the State of Tamil Nadu). If\\na prima facie case had been disclosed, then we could have entered\\ninto the other issue of territorial jurisdiction and issues emanating\\nfrom the principles of forum conveniens, comity of courts, etc. Now\\nthat we have come to the conclusion that no prima facie case is made\\nout going by the averments in the petition, there is no necessity for\\nus to get into the issues of territorial jurisdiction, forum conveniens,\\ncomity of courts, etc. It is on this premise that we have considered\\nthe various aspects in this case and arrived at the abovesaid\\nconclusion. None of the parties have raised such issues before us. If2023:KER:29723\\nW.P. (C) No.17521 of 2023 23\\nlater, the 7th respondent Chief Wild Life Warden, Tamil Nadu, is\\nconvinced that further recourse be made to any requisite lawful\\naction in relation to the matters within his discretion, then we\\ncannot presume that the said statutory authority would abdicate\\nfrom his statutory functions or that he would act illegally. It is made\\nclear that if a party, to subserve public interest, can convincingly\\nestablish that he or she has bona fide legally justiciable grievances in\\nrelation to the actions of respondents 6 to 8 (authorities of State of\\nTamil Nadu), etc., then this judgment will not preclude them from\\ninstituting appropriate writ proceedings before the Madras High\\nCourt for ventilation of such legally justiciable grievances and not\\nimaginary grievances.\\nThe Registry will forward copies of this judgment to\\nrespondents 6 to 8 by speed post for necessary information.\\nWith these observations and directions, the Writ Petition\\n(Civil) will stand dismissed.\\nSd/-\\nALEXANDER THOMAS, JUDGE\\nSd/-\\nC.

The matter is related to cancellation of\\npatta and transfer of registry in respect of the land comprised\\nin survey No.34/1 having an extent of 2.62 acres of Chinnakanal\\nVillage, Udumbanchola Taluk in Idukki District. Consequent upon\\ncancellation, land is ordered to be restored to the revenue\\ninvoking the Land Conservancy Act, 1957. A learned Single Judge2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:6:-\\nof this Court heard the matter relating to cancellation of patta\\nin W.P.(C).No.6954/2010 and affirmed the decision of revenue to\\ncancel the patta. This is how the writ appeal was filed. In the\\nland in question, a resort is being run, namely, Green Jungle\\nResort. Chinnakanal Grama Panchayat refused to issue licence\\nfor running the resort. Accordingly, W.P.(C).No.26746/2020 was\\nfiled. Since both matters are interconnected, these matters\\nare disposed of by a common judgment.\\n2. The Tahsildar of Udumbanchola Village initiated\\nproceedings for cancellation of the patta as against Joy Thomas\\nalleging that patta had been illegally obtained. He cited six\\nreasons in his show cause dated 10/4/2008 which reads as follows:\\n1)Application details are not found in Application Register and\\nAssignment Register.\\n2) No Chalan or other receipts towards payment of land value and other\\ncharges are found in the file.\\n3) Date is not entered in the Office Сору оf patta\\n4) The published copy of 12(1) notice at Taluk Office is not available\\nin the file.\\n5) In the Mahassar the land is described as CHR2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:7:-\\n6) The date of application for assignment was 19.09.1977, and the date\\nof order of assignment on registry was 22.4.1978. But the patta is\\nseen issued on 20.3.93 only, after a lapse of 15 years without\\nassigning any reason for the delay.\\n3. Joy Thomas is the patta holder. He transferred the\\nproperty to his nephew Jiji Zacharia, in the year 1995, and Jiji\\nZacharia transferred his property to his wife Anita Jiji in the\\nyear 2004 by a sale deed. After hearing all the parties, the\\npatta was cancelled as per order dated 12/5/2008; this was on\\nthe finding that the patta was illegally obtained by Joy Thomas,\\nsuppressing the fact that he had 4 acres of land and that he was\\nnot eligible to obtain patta. Apart from the above reason, the\\nTahsildar also doubted genuineness of the patta for the reason\\nthat there are no details of issuance of such patta in the\\nassignment register No.II maintained at the Nedumkandam\\noffice. Further, it was noted that there was no payment of the\\nland value, timber value, demarcation charges as per the law\\nunder Rule 9(7) of the Land Assignment Rules, 1964. It is also\\nnoted that patta is seen to be issued only after 15 years, and\\nas per the Rules, the patta should be issued within 3 months\\nafter the order of assignment. Thus, it is observed in the order2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:8:-\\nthat, both on the grounds of ineligibility and for want of proof\\nof genuineness of patta claimed, the land in question will have\\nto be restored to the revenue. It was taken up before the Land\\nRevenue Commissioner in revision. The Land Revenue Commissioner\\naffirmed the order of the Tahsildar by a detailed order. Apart\\nfrom the above, the Land Revenue Commissioner also noted that\\nland can be assigned only for the purpose of cultivation, and\\npresently, the land being used to run a resort is in violation\\nof the Land Assignment Rules. It is also noted in the order of\\nthe Land Revenue Commissioner that the land is situated in the\\nCardamom Hill Reserve and therefore, any illegal occupation of\\nthe land can only be regularised by obtaining patta under the\\nKerala Land Assignment (Regularisation of Occupations of Forest\\nLands prior to 1-1-1977) Special Rules, 1993 (hereinafter\\nreferred to as the ‘Special Rules’). However, it is seen that\\nthe patta has been issued under the Land Assignment Rules, 1964,\\nwhich clearly indicates a doubt regarding the genuineness of the\\npatta. The learned Single Judge who heard the matter relating\\nto cancellation of patta, found that patta is a forged document\\nand the assignee was not eligible to receive such patta. Apart2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:9:-\\nfrom the above, it is also found by the learned Single Judge\\nthat the land cannot be used other than the purpose for which it\\nwas issued and here the use of land was in violation of the\\nconditions of the patta. The learned Single Judge took note of\\nvarious precedents of this Court justifying cancellation of patta\\nfor violation of patta conditions.\\n4. We heard the learned counsel for the parties Shri\\nP.Ramakrishnan and learned Special Government Pleader Shri Jafar\\nKhan.\\n5. The learned counsel for the parties submitted that the\\npatta bears the seal of the competent authority and patta cannot\\nbe cancelled for the reason that application details are not\\nfound in the application register and challan receipts are not\\nfound in the file. It is further argued that there was delay in\\nremitting necessary charges for around 15 years and that was due\\nto refusal to accept challan consequent upon an interdictory\\norder passed by this Court in O.P.No.10797/1984. The interim\\norder in that case was vacated only in the year 1992. It is\\nfurther argued that though the Land Revenue Commissioner in2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:10:-\\nrevision entered a finding that the land is situated in Cardamom\\nHill Reserve, but such a finding was not entered by the Tahsildar\\nat the first instance; therefore, it is argued that validity of\\nthe impugned order before the Revisional Authority cannot be\\nsupplemented by fresh reasons.\\n6. The learned Special Government Pleader submitted that\\nthe land in question is situated in Cardamom Hill Reserve and in\\nrespect of land in Cardamom Hill Reserve, land cannot be assigned\\nunless it is included in the list of assignable lands prepared\\npursuant to joint verification.\\nBACKGROUND OF THE CASE:\\n7. An Expert Committee was constituted as per G.O.(P)\\nNo.3611/2003/RD, dated 17/11/2003, by the Government of Kerala\\nto unearth bogus pattas in Kannan Devan Hills Village. Expert\\nCommittee consists of Shri Rajan Madhekar, Additional Director\\nGeneral of Police (Intelligence) and Nivedita P. Haran, Principal\\nSecretary Revenue. This Committee submitted its report on\\n1/9/2006. The Committee found out large scale of encroachment\\nof revenue and forest land through issue of forged pattayams in2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:11:-\\nIdukki District with the support of revenue officials. A writ\\npetition is pending before this Court initiated as a Public\\nInterest Litigation from 2010 onwards. The present action\\ninitiated in this matter in the background of unearthing large\\nnumber of bogus pattas in Idukki District.\\nDISCUSSION AND FINDINGS:\\n8. We find that cancellation of patta is related to\\nineligibility of Joy Thomas to obtain such patta and also on the\\nground that the authority suspects it to be fabricated. To\\nunderstand this issue, we need to state the law of assignment of\\nland prevailing in the State of Kerala, particularly, in Idukki\\nDistrict. On formation of the State of Kerala in 1956, the State\\nLegislature made law, the Kerala Government Land Assignment Act,\\n1960. The State Government was given powers to make rules\\nprescribing the manner of assignment of land, qualification of\\nperson to whom assignment of land may be made, prescribing\\nauthority by which such assignment be made, etc.[See Section\\n7]. Section 4 of the Land Assignment Act emphasizes transparency\\nin land assignment by mandating that a notification be issued in2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:12:-\\nregard to assignment of land. Section 3 also mandates\\nconsultation with the Local Authority before the assignment of\\nthe land. In exercise of the powers conferred on the Government\\nby Section 7 of the Land Assignment Act, the State Government\\nformulated Kerala Land Assignment Rules, 1964 and the Special\\nRules, 1993. These two Rules are relevant in the context of this\\ncase. The Land Assignment Rules, 1964 mandates preparation of\\nthe list of assignable land before granting such assignment of\\nland on Registry. Needless to say, this preparation of the list\\ninsists that preparation has to be done in such a manner, keeping\\nfuture requirements of the Government or public purposes. That\\nmeans, before assignment of any parcel of land, a serious\\ndeliberation will have to be made with regard to the requirements\\nof the Government or public purposes in future. Rule 5 of the\\nLand Assignment Rules, 1964 prescribes maximum limit of land to\\nbe assigned for cultivation. It distinguishes lands located in\\nthe plains and the land located in hilly track for determining\\nthe maximum limit of land. Rule 7 prescribes priority to be\\nobserved in assignment of the land. This priority in fact, is\\nthe qualification or eligibility of the applicant for assignment.2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:13:-\\nIn a sense, it refers to income of the individual and family\\nseeking to obtain land on assignment. Significantly, both Rule\\n5 and Rule 7 refer to the right of an encroacher to obtain land\\non assignment, though no such power conferred upon the Government\\nis traceable under the parent Act.\\n9. The Special Rules 1993 were framed by the Government\\ninvoking powers under Section 7 of the Land Assignment Act 1960\\nfor assignment, settlement and regularisation of forest lands\\nunder occupation prior to 1/1/1977. The validity of these\\nSpecial Rules was upheld by the Apex Court in Nature Lovers\\nMovement v. State of Kerala and Others [(2009) 5 SCC 373].\\n10. Land is defined under Rule 2(f) of the Special Rules,\\n1993 as follows:\\n“Land\" means the Forest land subjected to joint verification as\\ndefined in sub-clause (e) and Cardamom Hill Reserve land which are\\nconverted for non-cardamom cultivation prior to 1-1-1977 in Idukki\\nDistrict which have been transferred from Forest Department to Revenue\\nDepartment and covered in the Resurvey Records and list of lands\\nrecommended to Government of India for concurrence under Section 2 of\\nthe Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (Central Act 69 of 1980) but does\\nnot include lands in wild life Sanctuaries.2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:14:-\\n11. Rule 6 of the Special Rules mandates the preparation\\nof a list of assignable lands. Rule 6 states as follows:\\n6. List of assignable lands and applications.- (1) The joint\\nverification reports or the records of resurvey of the land conducted\\nunder the Kerala Survey and Boundaries Act, 1961 (Act 37 of 1961)\\ncontaining the details of lands found eligible for assignment under\\nthese Rules shall be published in the concerned Village Offices and\\nTaluk Offices inviting applications for assignment within the period\\nspecified therein.\\n(2) Application for assignment shall be made in Form No.2 before\\nthe Tahsildar within seven days of the publication of the list. (3)\\nEach application shall bear court-fee stamp of the value of Rupees two.\\nNote.- Applicants belonging to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes\\nshall be exempt from affixing court fee stamp on their applications.\\nThat means to assign any land under the Special Rules 1993, the\\nland must be included in the list of assignable lands and no\\nland can be assigned under the Special Rules without including\\nsuch land in the list of assignable lands.\\n12. The land in this question is admittedly situated in\\nChinnakanal Village of Udumbanchola Taluk. The extent of the\\nland is 2.62 acres. Joy Thomas appears to have claimed that he\\nmade an application for assignment of land having an extent of\\n4 acres on 19/9/1977. He has no claim that it was a land allotted2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:15:-\\nto him or given to him on lease or conveyed through other\\ninstrument; that means, his claim for patta is by way of a claim\\nas an encroacher. He claims that an order of assignment on\\nregistry was issued on 22/4/1978 to assign 2.62 acres of\\nland. And as per the order of assignment he has to pay Rs.63.62\\npaise towards the land value. He places reliance on a mahazar\\nprepared on 22/3/1978 and a notice issued to him for an inquiry\\nunder Rule 12 of the Land Assignment Rules 1964. This notice is\\ndated 12/3/1978 (Sunday). Joy Thomas claims to have remitted\\nnecessary charges. Before the Land Revenue Commissioner,\\nAnnexure 15 was produced along with a memorandum of revision to\\nevidence payment of value for land and trees. The Land Revenue\\nCommissioner observed that the month and year were written as\\nMarch 1997 and was corrected as 1993. That means the remittance\\nalleged to have been made by him is much after the issuance of\\npatta, though the rule states that payment will have to be\\neffected within three months of order of assignment of\\nregistry. And further receipt of such payment can be made only\\nafter condoning delay. Anyway strangely, the payment of challan2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:16:-\\nalleged to have been effected is not seen produced before this\\nCourt.\\n13. This case has to be examined in the background of the\\ncase as above. Joy Thomas claims that his father was in\\noccupation of the land prior to 1966, asserting his status as an\\nencroacher. However, it is not included in the assignable land\\nas mandated under Rule 11. It is not possible for an encroacher\\nto get an assignment of land assuming that Joy Thomas had made\\nsuch an application without such land being included in\\nassignable list. It is to be noted that even though he obtained\\nland as an encroacher, the applicant has to prove that he does\\nnot own land in proprietary right exceeding the maximum limit of\\nland assignable under Rule 5, and his family income does not\\nexceed Rs.10,000/- from all sources. The alleged assignment\\naccording to him was made in the year 1978. The rule as on that\\nday prescribes Rs.10,000/- as source of income to become\\neligible. Joy Thomas deposed before the Tahsildar in inquiry\\nthat he holds 4 acres of land and he sold this in 1979 to purchase\\nthe land of 1 acre of land in Punalur and in further inquiry it2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:17:-\\nwas disclosed by him that he was in Saudi Arabia and he never\\nstayed or cultivated in the land.\\n14. The land is situated in Cardamom Hill Reserve. The\\nalleged mahazar produced in this matter by the parties show that\\nit is Cardamom Hill Reserve. The learned Special Government\\nPleader also pointed out that the land in question is indeed a\\nCardamom Hill Reserve. Therefore, it is impossible to include\\nit in the assignable list in the year 1977 for assignment of\\nland under the Land Assignment Rules, 1964. In fact in the\\nnotice issued by the Tahsildar, it was pointed out that the land\\nis situated in Cardamom Hill Reserve. In the statement filed by\\nJoy Thomas, he also admits that the land is in Cardamom Hill\\nReserve puramboke, to mean that it is unfit for cardamom\\ncultivation. In respect of converted land in Cardamom Hill\\nReserve where cardamom is cultivated, Special Rules 1993 would\\nalone be applicable for claiming assignment by an encroacher. To\\nclaim assignment under the Special Rules 1993, he has to prove\\nthat the encroachment was prior to 1/1/1977, and the land has\\nbeen included in the list of assignable lands. The encroacher2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:18:-\\nof land in Cardamom Hill Reserve converted for non-cardamom\\ncultivation prior to 1/1/1977 can claim regularisation of land\\nin accordance with the Special Rules 1993. The parties have no\\ncase that the assignment was in accordance with the Special Rules\\n1993. In any way, we are of the view that the petitioner cannot\\nclaim assignment of land under the Special Rules, 1993 for the\\nreason that it was not included in the list prepared under\\nSpecial Rules 1993. In such scenario he could not have made an\\napplication under Land Assignment Rules, 1964 in respect of land\\nwhich is coming under the Cardamom Hill Reserve; for the obvious\\nreason that if such encroachment is under the Special Rules,\\n1993, it cannot clandestinely acknowledged under the Land\\nAssignment Rules, 1964. Anyway, the petitioner’s claim being\\nunder the Land Assignment Rules, 1964 and claim alleged to have\\nbeen made in the year 1977, there is no point in discussing the\\nimpact of the Special Rules, 1993 in as much as the Special Rules\\ncame into effect in the year 1993.\\n15. As we already noted, Joy Thomas was not eligible to\\napply under the Land Assignment Rules, 1964 as he was having 42024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:19:-\\nacres of land and his income was not proved to be less than\\nRs.10,000/-. It is in this background we are sure that patta\\nwas obtained by Joy Thomas illegally with the connivance of\\npublic officials or might have been fabricated for the following\\nreasons.\\n(1). Joy Thomas was not eligible for the reasons\\nstated in the aforenoted para.\\n(2). No challan receipt was produced to evidence\\nthe payment of value of tree and land.\\n(3). The challan receipt produced before the\\nTahsildar and the Land Revenue Commissioner shows that\\nit was dated as March 1997 and corrected as 1993.\\n(4). The appellants and the writ petitioners\\nherein for obvious reasons did not produce receipt before\\nthis Court for perusal.\\n(5). As per Appendix I, the form of order of\\nassignment on registry, issued under Rule 9(1) of the\\nLand Assignment Rules, 1964, in clause 14, it is2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:20:-\\nprescribed that if the assignee does not remit land value\\nwithin three months of sanctioning registry, registry\\nshall be cancelled. The order of assignment admittedly\\nwas on 22/4/1978, and the patta was issued only in\\n1993. Absolutely, no evidence was produced to show that\\nthe remittance was made or any authority had condoned\\ndelay in receiving the payment of value. This would\\nclearly show that patta was created either with the help\\nof public officials or by Joy Thomas himself.\\n6. Details of patta are to be mentioned in Register\\nNo.II reflecting payment of remittance of the amount from\\ndate of issuance of patta and initials of the\\nTahsildar. The learned Special Government Pleader made\\navailable before this Court a copy of the register along\\nwith memo dated 13/11/2023. The petitioner also\\nproduced extract of Register No II. In that though the\\nname of Joy Thomas was shown, there is no details of\\npayment effected, date of issuance of patta or initials\\nof the Tahsildar. This would show that some public2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:21:-\\nofficials were also involved in the matter in creating\\nsuch bogus patta.\\n7.

Under the Rules, land can be utilised only for\\nthe purpose of agriculture activities, but admittedly it\\nis being used for running a resort.\\n16. The authorities had given fullest opportunity to Joy\\nThomas, Jiji Zacharia and his wife Anitha Jiji. All factual\\nfoundations were settled in the original notice itself. Though\\nreasons assigned in the revision might be more elaborate than\\none rendered by the primary authority, it is to be noted that\\nall reasons were assigned on the primary facts referred in the\\nshow cause notice issued to the parties and no prejudice has\\nbeen caused to the parties, as reasons assigned by the Land\\nRevenue Commissioner (Revision) being different from the reasons\\nassigned in the original order. We are sure that this patta was2024:KER:6755\\nWA 918/2023 AND WPC 26746/2020\\n-:22:-\\ncreated illegally either with the help of public officials or\\nmight have been fabricated by Joy Thomas and other parties and\\nhis subsequent assignee.

              " '1\\nREPORTABLE\\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\\nCIVIL APPEAL NO.11923 OF 2018\\nMARUTI SUZUKI INDIA LTD.\\n(EARLIER KNOWN AS MARUTI UDYOG LTD.) ...APPELLANT(S)\\nVERSUS\\nCOMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, DELHI ...RESPONDENT(S)\\nWITH\\nCIVIL APPEAL NO.11924 OF 2018\\nJ U D G M E N T\\nASHOK BHUSHAN,J.\\nBy these appeals the assessee has challenged\\nthe judgment of the High Court of Delhi dated\\n07.12.2017 deciding the Income Tax Appeal No.31 of\\n2005. ITA No.31 of 2005 related to Assessment year\\n1999\\xad2000 and ITA No.442 of 2005 related to\\nAssessment year 2000\\xad2001, in both the appeal2\\nsimilar questions were answered against the\\nassessee. For deciding these two appeals it is\\nsufficient to notice the facts in CA No.11923 of\\n2018 for Assessment Year 1999\\xad2000. The High Court\\nby the impugned judgment has affirmed the views of\\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal on the questions\\nwhich have been raised in this appeal. The\\nAssessing Officer as well as the Commissioner of\\nIncome Tax (Appeals) has not accepted the claim of\\nthe appellant. The appellant (hereinafter referred\\nto as the “assessee”) is engaged in the business of\\nmanufacturing automobiles, which are chargeable to\\nExcise Duty under the Central Excise Act, 1994. The\\nassessment year in question is assessment year\\n1999\\xad2000. The assessee, a Company, has been\\nengaged in manufacturing and sale of various Maruti\\nCars and also trades in spares and components of\\nthe vehicles. It acquires exiceable raw materials\\nand inputs which are used in the manufacturing of\\nthe vehicles. The assessee had also been taking3\\nbenefit of MODVAT credit on the raw material and\\ninputs used in the manufacturing. At the end of the\\nAssessment year 1999\\xad2000 an amount of\\nRs.69,93,00,428/\\xad was left as unutilised MODVAT\\ncredit. In the return it was claimed that the\\nCompany was eligible for deduction under Section\\n43B of the Income Tax Act as an allowable\\ndeduction. Similarly, the Company claimed deduction\\nunder Section 43B of an amount of Rs. 3,08,88,171/\\xad\\nin respect of Sales Tax Recoverable Account.\\n2. The Assessing Officer passed assessment order\\ndated 28.03.2002. The Assessing Officer disallowed\\nthe claim of deduction of Rs.69,93,00,428/\\xad as well\\nas Rs.3,08,99,171/\\xad. Aggrieved by the assessment\\norder, the assessee filed an appeal before the\\nCommissioner of Income Tax. The Commissioner of\\nIncome Tax also sustained the disallowance of the\\nabove two items. An appeal to ITAT met the same\\nfate. The ITAT took the view that the advance4\\npayment of Excise Duty which represented unutilised\\nMODVAT credit without incurring the liability of\\nsuch payment is not an allowable deduction under\\nSection 43B. The assessee filed an appeal under\\nSection 260A of the Income Tax Act in the High\\nCourt. The High Court answered question Nos.(ii)\\nand ((iii) relating to the above noted disallowance\\nin favour of the Revenue. Aggrieved by the judgment\\nof the High Court, these appeals have been filed.\\n3. The two questions which were answered by the\\nHigh Court in favour of the Revenue which were\\nsubject matter of this appeal are question Nos.(ii)\\nand (iii) as framed by the High Court are to the\\nfollowing effect:\\n\"(ii) Whether the ITAT had committed an\\nerror of law in upholding the\\ndisallowance of the amount of\\nRs.69,93,00,428/\\xad which represented\\nMODVAT credit of Excise Duty that\\nremained unutilised by 31st March, 1999\\ni.e. the end of the relevant accounting\\nyear ?\\n(iii) Whether the ITAT has committed an5\\nerror of law in upholding the\\ndisallowance of Rs.3,08,99,171/\\xad in\\nrespect of Sales Tax Recoverable\\nAccount, under Section 43B of the\\nIncome\\xadtax Act ?”\\n4. We have heard Shri S. Ganesh, learned senior\\ncounsel for the appellant\\xadassessee and Shri Arijit\\nPrasad, learned senior counsel for the Revenue.\\n5. Shri Ganesh submits that the amount paid by\\nway of Excise Duty by the assessee to its suppliers\\nof raw materials and inputs, is accepted as Excise\\nDuty under the provisions of Central Excise Act and\\nRules. Consequently, when the said payments are\\nmade by the assessee to its suppliers, they should\\nbe treated as payments of Excise Duty which\\nstraightaway qualify for deduction under Section\\n43B of the Income Tax Act, irrespective of whether\\nor when the MODVAT credit arising from such\\npayments is utilised to make payment of Excise Duty\\non the products manufactured by the assessee. The6\\nHigh Court erroneously held that the above payments\\nmade by the assessee are mere contractual payments\\nand not payments by way of Excise Duty. As soon as\\nthe raw materials and inputs are received in the\\nappellant\\'s factory, the assessee becomes entitled\\nto avail of MODVAT credit in respect of Excise Duty\\npaid on the raw materials and inputs and which is\\nmentioned in the manufacturer\\xadsupplier\\'s invoice.\\nThe assessee was clearly entitled for deduction of\\nunutilised MODVAT credit balance as on 31.03.1999.\\n6. Shri Ganesh in alternative submits that\\nquestions are squarely covered in favour of the\\nassessee by the 1st proviso to Section 43B. The\\nassessee\\'s Excise Returns establish that while the\\nuntilised MODVAT credit as on 31.03.1999 was Rs.\\n69.30 crores, the entire amount was utilised in\\nApril, 1999 itself. Consequently, the assessee is\\nentitled to the deduction under the 1st proviso to\\nSection 43B. The object and purpose of Section 43B7\\nof the Act is to ensure that an assessee does not\\nget deduction in respect of an amount unless and\\nuntil the amount has been received by the\\nGovernment. In the present case the full amount of\\nExcise Duty was paid into the coffers of Government\\nwhen the manufacturer of raw material/inputs had\\ncleared the same from his factory gate for supply\\nto the assessee. The basic object of Section 43B of\\nthe Act is fully subserved and deduction should\\nhave been granted as claimed by the assessee.\\n7. Shri Arijit Prasad, learned senior counsel for\\nthe Revenue refuting the submissions of the learned\\ncounsel for the assessee contends that deduction\\nunder Section 43B is allowable only when the amount\\nof tax, cess etc. are due and payable and the\\nassessee actually pays the same. In the present\\ncase the Excise Duty becomes due and payable only\\nwhen the assessee removes the finished product from\\nthe factory gate, at the point in time when the8\\nassessee makes payment to the suppliers the Excise\\nDuty is not due and payable. It is not in dispute\\nthat the assessee was entitled to the duty paid by\\nit to the manufacturer under Rule 57A to Rule 571\\nof the Central Excise Rules, 1944. Further it is\\nnot in dispute that the assessee was entitled to\\nutilise MODVAT credit towards payment of Excise\\nDuty leviable on the final products manufactured by\\nit. The liability under the Central Excise Act to\\npay Excise Duty is only on the manufacture of the\\nexcisable goods. The assessee is not one who is\\nliable to pay Excise Duty on the raw\\nmaterials/inputs. It is merely the incidence of\\nExcise Duty that has shifted from the manufacturer\\nto the purchaser and not the liability to pay the\\nsame. Answering the submission of counsel for the\\nassessee based on proviso to Section 43B, it is\\nsubmitted that liability to pay Excise Duty of the\\nassessee is incurred on the removal of the finished\\ngoods in the subsequent year, therefore, on9\\n31.03.1999, the assessee was not liable to pay the\\nExcise Duty and, therefore, the proviso will also\\nnot come to the aid of the assessee.\\n8. We have considered the submissions of the\\nlearned counsel for the parties and perused the\\nrecords.\\n9. The two issues which need to be answered by us\\nin these appeals are:\\n\"(i) Whether the ITAT had committed an\\nerror of law in upholding the\\ndisallowance of the amount of\\nRs.69,93,00,428/\\xad which represented\\nMODVAT credit of Excise Duty that\\nremained unutilised by 31st March, 1999\\ni.e. the end of the relevant accounting\\nyear ?\\n(ii) Whether the ITAT has committed an\\nerror of law in upholding the\\ndisallowance of Rs.3,08,99,171/\\xad in\\nrespect of Sales Tax Recoverable\\nAccount, under Section 43B of the\\nIncome\\xadtax Act ?”\\n10. We need to first notice the provisions of\\nSection 43B under which deduction is sought to be10\\nclaimed. Section 43B is as follows:\\n“43B.Certain deductions to be only on\\nactual payment.\\xadNotwithstanding anything\\ncontained in any other provision of this\\nAct, a deduction otherwise allowable under\\nthis Act in respect of—\\n(a) any sum payable by the assessee by way\\nof tax, duty, cess or fee, by whatever\\nname called, under any law for the time\\nbeing in force, or\\n(b)any sum payable by the assessee as an\\nemployer by way of contribution to any\\nprovident fund or superannuation fund or\\ngratuity fund or any other fund for the\\nwelfare of employees, or\\n(c)any sum referred to in clause (ii) of\\nsub\\xadsection (1) of section 36, or\\n(d)any sum payable by the assessee as\\ninterest on any loan or borrowing from\\nany public financial institution or a\\nState financial corporation or a State\\nindustrial investment corporation, in\\naccordance with the terms and conditions\\nof the agreement governing such loan or\\nborrowing, or11\\n(e) any sum payable by the assessee as\\ninterest on any loan or advances from a\\nscheduled bank[or a co\\xadoperative bank\\nother than a primary agricultural credit\\nsociety or a primary co\\xadoperative\\nagricultural and rural development bank]\\nin accordance with the terms and\\nconditions of the agreement governing\\nsuch loan or advances, or\\n(f)any sum payable by the assessee as an\\nemployer in lieu of any leave at the\\ncredit of his employee, or\\n(g)any sum payable by the assessee to the\\nIndian Railways for the use of railway\\nassets,\\nshall be allowed (irrespective of the\\nprevious year in which the liability to pay\\nsuch sum was incurred by the assessee\\naccording to the method of accounting\\nregularly employed by him) only in\\ncomputing the income referred to in Section\\n28 of that previous year in which such sum\\nis actually paid by him :\\nProvided that nothing contained in this\\nsection shall apply in relation to any sum\\nwhich is actually paid by the assessee on\\nor before the due date applicable in his\\ncase for furnishing the return of income\\nunder sub\\xadsection (1) of section 139 in12\\nrespect of the previous year in which the\\nliability to pay such sum was incurred as\\naforesaid and the evidence of such payment\\nis furnished by the assessee along with\\nsuch return.\\n....”\\n11. The untilised MODVAT credit on 31.03.1999 to\\nthe credit of the assessee was Rs.69,93,00,428/\\xad.\\nThe MODVAT credit was accumulated to the account of\\nthe assessee due to payment of Excise Duty on raw\\nmaterials and inputs which were supplied to it by\\nthe suppliers and reflected in the invoices by\\nwhich raw materials and inputs were supplied. There\\nis no denial to the fact that the appellant was\\nentitled to utilise this credit in payment of\\nExcise Duty to which the assessee was liable in\\npayment of Excise Duty on manufacture of its\\nproducts. When we analyse provision of Section 43B\\nof the Act the provision indicates that deduction\\nthereunder is to be allowed on fulfilment of the\\nfollowing conditions:13\\n\"a.there should be an actual payment of\\nExcise Duty whether “by way of tax,\\nduty, cess or fee, by whatever name”;\\nb.such payment has to be “under any law\\nfor the time being in force”;\\nc.the payment of such sum should have\\nbeen made by the assessee;\\nd.irrespective of the method of\\naccounting regularly employed by the\\nassessee, deduction shall be allowed\\nwhile computing the income tax for\\nthe previous year “in which sum is\\nactually paid” by the assessee;\\ne.the expression “any such sum payable”\\nrefers to a sum for which the\\nassessee incurred liability in the\\nprevious year even though such sum\\nmight not have been payable within\\nthat year under the relevant law.”\\n12. The fulfillment of the above statutory\\nconditions is necessary for allowing deduction\\nunder Section 43B. We have to examine the facts of\\nthe present case to find out as to whether all the\\nconditions which are necessary for permissible\\ndeduction under Section 43B are present here or\\nnot.14\\n13. The crucial words in Section 43B(a) are “any\\nsum payable by the assessee by way of tax, duty,\\ncess or fee...”. We need to examine as to whether\\nunutilised credit under MODVAT Scheme was sum\\npayable by the assessee.\\n14. The Excise Duty is levied under the Central\\nExcise Act, 1944 and collected as per the Central\\nExcise Rules, 1944. The assessee in reference to\\nthe Central Excise Rules, 1944 is Assessee as\\ndefined in Rule 2(3) which is to the following\\neffect:\\xad\\n“Rule 2(3). “assessee” means\\nany person who is liable for\\npayment of duty assessed and also\\nincludes any producer or\\nmanufacturer of excisable goods or\\na registered person of a private\\nwarehouse in which excisable goods\\nare stored;”\\n15. The taxable event is manufacture and15\\nproduction of excisable articles and payment of\\nduty is relatable to date of removal of such\\narticle from the factory. The manufacture of the\\nraw materials or inputs which have been used by\\nthe appellant are the excisable items within the\\nmeaning of Central Excise Rules, 1944. The Excise\\nDuty is leviable on the manufacturer of raw\\nmaterials and inputs. The supplier of raw\\nmaterials or inputs includes the Excise Duty paid\\non such articles in his sale invoices. The\\nappellant when purchases raw materials and inputs\\nfor manufacture of vehicles it maintains a\\nseparate account containing the Excise Duty as\\nmentioned in sale invoices. The credit of such\\nExcise Duty paid by the appellant is to be given\\nto the appellant by virtue of Rule 57A to 57F of\\nCentral Excise Rules, 1944 as it then existed. The\\nappellant was fully entitled to discharge his\\nliability to pay Excise Duty on vehicles\\nmanufactured by adjusting the credit of Excise16\\nDuty earned by it as per MODVAT scheme. The\\nliability to pay Excise Duty is not fastened on\\ntwo entities as per the scheme of Central Excise\\nAct and Central Excise Rules. It is the\\nmanufacturer of raw materials and inputs which are\\nused by appellant who has statutory liability to\\npay Excise Duty. The appellant is not assessee\\nwithin the meaning of Central Excise Act, 1944,\\nwith reference to raw materials and inputs\\nmanufactured by the entities from which appellant\\nhad purchased the raw materials and entities.\\n16. As per Section 43B(a) of Income Tax Act,\\ndeduction is allowed on “any sum payable by the\\nassessee by way of tax, duty, cess or fee.” The\\ncredit of Excise Duty earned by the appellant under\\nMODVAT scheme as per Central Excise Rules, 1944 is\\nnot sum payable by the assessee by way of tax,\\nduty, cess. The scheme under Section 43B is to\\nallow deduction when a sum is payable by assessee17\\nby way of tax, duty and cess and had been actually\\npaid by him.\\n17. Furthermore, the deductions under Section 43B\\nis allowable only when sum is actually paid by the\\nassessee. In the present case, the Excise Duty\\nleviable on appellant on manufacture of vehicles\\nwas already adjusted in the concerned assessment\\nyear from the credit of Excise Duty under the\\nMODVAT scheme. The unutilised credit in the MODVAT\\nscheme cannot be treated as sum actually paid by\\nthe appellant. The assessee when pays the cost of\\nraw materials where the duty is embedded, it does\\nnot ipso facto mean that assessee is the one who is\\nliable to pay Excise Duty on such raw\\nmaterial/inputs. It is merely the incident of\\nExcise Duty that has shifted from the manufacturer\\nto the purchaser and not the liability to the same.\\n18. We thus, conclude that the unutilised credit\\nunder MODVAT scheme does not qualify for deductions18\\nunder Section 43B of the Income Tax Act.\\n19. Shri Ganesh has relied on judgment of this\\nCourt in Eicher Motors Ltd. and another versus\\nUnion of India and others, (1999) 2 SCC 361, and\\nsubmits that facility of credit is as good as tax\\npaid, hence, it be accepted that by payment of\\nExcise Duty although which is part of sale invoice\\nissued by manufacturer or producer of raw material\\nor inputs, the payment by appellant was Excise Duty\\nwhich qualified for deduction under Section 43B.\\n20. In Eicher Motors Ltd. and another, the\\nchallenge to the validity of scheme as modified by\\nintroduction of Rule 57F of Central Excise Rules,\\n1944 was under consideration. According to Section\\n57\\xadF(4A) of Central Excise Rules, 1944, credit\\nwhich was lying unutilised on 16.03.1995 with the\\nmanufacturers, stood lapsed, Rule 57\\xadF(4\\xadA) has\\nbeen extracted in paragraph 2 of the judgment which\\nis to the following effect: \\xad19\\n“2. The relevant Rule reads as\\nfollows:\\n“57\\xadF. (4\\xadA) Notwithstanding\\nanything contained in sub\\xadrule (4),\\nor sub\\xadrule (1) of Rule 57\\xadA and\\nthe notifications issued\\nthereunder, any credit of specified\\nduty lying unutilised on the 16th\\nday of March, 1995 with a\\nmanufacturer of tractors, falling\\nunder Heading No. 87.01 or motor\\nvehicles falling under Heading No.\\n87.02 and 87.04 [or chassis of such\\ntractors or such motor vehicles\\nunder Heading No. 87.06] of the\\nSchedule to the Central Excise\\nTariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) shall\\nlapse and shall not be allowed to\\nbe utilised for payment of duty on\\nany excisable goods, whether\\ncleared for home consumption or for\\nexport:\\nProvided that nothing contained\\nin this sub\\xadrule shall apply to\\ncredit of duty, if any, in respect\\nof inputs lying in stock or\\ncontained in finished products\\nlying in stock on the 16th day of\\nMarch, 1995.”\\n21. This Court in reference to 57\\xadF(4\\xadA) took the\\nview that right to credit had become absolute at\\nany rate when the input is used in the manufacture20\\nof the final products. This court held that the\\nscheme sought to be introduced cannot be made\\napplicable to the goods which had already come into\\nexistence in respect of which the earlier Scheme\\nwas applied. Following observations have been made\\nby this Court in paragraph 5 of the above\\njudgment:\\xad\\n“As pointed out by us that when\\non the strength of the Rules\\navailable, certain acts have been\\ndone by the parties concerned,\\nincidents following thereto must\\ntake place in accordance with the\\nScheme under which the duty had been\\npaid on the manufactured products\\nand if such a situation is sought to\\nbe altered, necessarily it follows\\nthat the right, which had accrued to\\na party such as the availability of\\na scheme, is affected and, in\\nparticular, it loses sight of the\\nfact that the provision for facility\\nof credit is as good as tax paid\\ntill tax is adjusted on future goods\\non the basis of the several\\ncommitments which would have been\\nmade by the assessees concerned.\\nTherefore, the Scheme sought to be\\nintroduced cannot be made applicable\\nto the goods which had already come\\ninto existence in respect of which21\\nthe earlier Scheme was applied under\\nwhich the assessees had availed of\\nthe credit facility for payment of\\ntaxes. It is on the basis of the\\nearlier Scheme necessarily that the\\ntaxes have to be adjusted and\\npayment made complete. Any manner or\\nmode of application of the said Rule\\nwould result in affecting the rights\\nof the assessees.”\\n22. The observations in the above paragraph that\\nfacility of credit is as good as tax paid till tax\\nis adjusted on future goods were made in context of\\n57\\xadF(4\\xadA) of Central Excise Rules,1944.\\n23. The above observation cannot be read to mean\\nthat payment of Excise Duty by the appellant which\\nwas component of sale invoice purchasing the raw\\nmaterial/inputs by the appellant is also payment of\\nExcise Duty on raw material/inputs.\\n24. By payment of component of Excise Duty as\\nincluded in sale invoice is benefit which is given\\nto appellant by virtue of credit as envisaged in\\nstatutory scheme of Rule 57\\xadA to 57\\xadI of Central22\\nExcise Rules, 1944. The above judgment thus in no\\nmanner supports the submissions of the appellant\\nfor the purposes of the present case.\\n25. Next judgment relied by Shri Ganesh in\\nCollector of Central Excise, Pune and others\\nversus Dai Ichi Karkaria Ltd. and others; (1999) 7\\nSCC 448. In the above case, this Court had\\noccasion to consider Section 4 of Central Excise\\nAct, 1944, which provides for valuation of raw\\nmaterial covered by MODVAT Scheme. Referring to\\nRule 57\\xadA(1) and Rule 57\\xadF(1), this Court laid\\ndown following in paragraph 18, 19 and 20: \\xad\\n“18. It is clear from these\\nrules, as we read them, that a\\nmanufacturer obtains credit for the\\nExcise Duty paid on raw material to\\nbe used by him in the production of\\nan excisable product immediately it\\nmakes the requisite declaration and\\nobtains an acknowledgment thereof.\\nIt is entitled to use the credit at\\nany time thereafter when making\\npayment of Excise Duty on the\\nexcisable product...23\\n19. It is, therefore, that in\\nthe case of Eicher Motors Ltd. vs.\\nUnion of India, this Court said\\nthat a credit under the MODVAT\\nScheme was as good as tax paid.\\n20. With this in mind, we must\\nnow determine whether the Excise\\nDuty paid on the raw material\\nshould form part of the cost of the\\nexcisable product for the purposes\\nof Section 4(1)(b) of the Act read\\nwith Rule 6 of the Valuation\\nRules.”\\n26. In the above case, this Court held that in\\ndetermining the cost of the excisable product\\ncovered by MODVAT Scheme under Section 4(1)(b) of\\nthe Act read with Rule 6 of the Valuation Rules,\\nthe Excise Duty paid on raw material covered by\\nMODVAT Scheme is not to be included. The question\\nwhich was answered in the above case was entirely\\ndifferent to one which has arisen in the present\\ncase.\\n27. This Court as noted above in the above case has\\nlaid down that credit for the Excise Duty paid for24\\nthe raw material can be used at any time when\\nmaking payment of Excise Duty on excisable product.\\nThe user of such credit is at the time of payment\\nof Excise Duty on the excisable product i.e. at the\\ntime when appellant is to pay Excise Duty on its\\nmanufactured vehicle.\\n28. The judgment of this Court in Berger Paints\\nIndia Ltd. versus Commissioner of Income Tax, 2004\\n(266) ITR 99, has also been referred to. The\\nassessee company in the above case had claimed that\\nunder Section 43B of the Income Tax Act, it was\\nentitled to deduction of the entire sum being the\\nduties actually paid during the relevant previous\\nyears. The appellant in the year in question had\\nincurred expenditure on account of customs and\\nExcise Duty aggregating to Rs.5,85,87,181/\\xad which\\nwas duties debited to the profit and loss account\\nof the company for the relevant previous year. In\\nassessment proceedings the company’s claim that it25\\nwas entitled to deduct the entire sum of\\nRs.5,85,87,181/\\xad being the duties actually paid\\nduring the relevant year was accepted. The\\nCommissioner of Income Tax initiated proceedings\\nunder Section 263 of the Act claiming that\\nAssessing officer had wrongly allowed the claim for\\ndeduction. The Commissioner held that assessing\\nofficer incorrectly relied on judgment of Gujarat\\nHigh Court in Lakhan Pal National Ltd. versus ITO\\n(1986) 162 ITR 240, ITAT also. ITAT referred a\\nquestion to the High Court. The High Court answered\\nthe question in favour of Revenue against which the\\nappeal was filed. The relevant facts have been\\nnoticed in the judgment of this Court in following\\nwords: \\xad\\n“...In the assessment proceedings of\\nthe assessment year 1984\\xad85, the\\nInspecting Assistant Commissioner of\\nIncome\\xadtax allowed the appellant\\xad\\nassessee’s claim that it was entitled\\nto deduct the entire sum of\\nRs.5,85,87,181/\\xad being the duties\\nactually paid during the relevant year26\\nprevious to the assessment year 1984\\xad\\n85. The Commissioner of Income\\xadtax\\ninitiated proceedings under section 263\\nof the Act on the ground that the\\nAssessing Officer had wrongly allowed\\nthe claim for deduction of an amount of\\nRs.98,25,833/\\xad towards customs and\\nExcise Duty paid during the previous\\nyear but credited to the profit and\\nloss account in closing stock of goods\\nunder the provisions of Section 43B.\\nthe assessee relied upon the judgment\\nof the Gujarat high Court in Lakhanpal\\nNational Ltd. Vs. ITO[1986] 162 ITR\\n240[hereinafter referred to as\\n“Lakhanpal National Ltd.’s case”] in\\nsupport of its claim. The Commissioner\\nof Income\\xadtax took the view that the\\nGujarat High Court’s decision was\\ndistinguishable on facts and,\\ntherefore, made an order under section\\n263 of the Act disallowing the claim of\\nthe assessee. On appeal to the\\nTribunal, the Tribunal held that the\\nGujarat high court’s judgment in\\nLakhanpal National Ltd.’s case [1986]\\n162 ITR 240 was distinguishable and\\nconfirmed the order of the Commissioner\\nof Income\\xadtax. On an application made\\nunder section 256(1) of the Act at the\\ninstance of the appellant\\xadassessee, the\\nTribunal, inter alia, referred the\\nfollowing question of law for the\\nopinion of the High Court (see [2002]\\n253 IT 738, 739):\\n“Whether, on the facts and in\\nthe circumstances of the case, the\\nTribunal was right in law in27\\nrejecting the assessee’s claim for\\ndeduction of the excise and\\ncustoms duties of Rs.98,25,833\\npaid in the year of account and\\ndebited in the profit and loss\\naccount, on the ground that the\\ncrediting of the profit and loss\\naccount by the value of the\\nclosing stock, which included the\\naforesaid duties, did not have the\\neffect of wiping out the debit to\\nthe profit and loss account?”\\nThe High Court by its judgment dated\\nSeptember 24, 2001, in I.T.R.No.213 of\\n1993 (see [2002] 253 ITR 738), answered\\nthe question referred in favour of the\\nRevenue and against the assessee.”\\n29. This Court in Berger Paints Ltd. (Supra)\\nupheld the view of assessing officer and decided\\nthe question in favour of the assessee. This Court\\nheld that the Commissioner of Income Tax has\\nincorrectly distinguished the judgment of Lakhan\\nPal National Ltd. Case.\\n30. As noted above in the above case, the claim of\\nthe assessee was that entire sum of\\nRs.5,85,87,181/\\xad was the duties actually paid28\\nduring the relevant previous year. The above was\\nnot a case for unutilised MODVAT credit, hence, the\\nsaid case cannot be held to lay down any ratio with\\nrespect to allowable deduction under Section 43B in\\nrespect of unutilised MODVAT credit.\\n31. Now coming to the second question i.e. with\\nregard to disallowance of Rs.3,08,79,171/\\xad in\\nrespect of Sale tax recoverable amount,the High\\nCourt in paragraph 52 of the judgment has noticed\\nrelevant facts in above reference in following\\nwords: \\xad\\n“52. The facts are the Assessee\\npays sales tax on the purchase of\\nraw materials and computers used in\\nthe manufacture of cars. Though,\\nthe sales\\xadtax paid is part of the\\ncost of raw material, the Assessee\\ndebits the purchases net of sales\\ntax; the sales tax paid is debited\\nto a separate account titled\\n‘Sales\\xadtax Recoverable A/c”. Under\\nthe Haryana General Sales Tax Act\\n1973, the Assessee cold set off\\nsuch sales\\xadtax against its\\nliability on the sales of the29\\nfinished goods i.e. cars. Whenever\\nthe goods are sold, the tax on such\\nsales is credited to the aforesaid\\naccount.”\\n32. The High Court had rightly answered the above\\nquestion in favour of the Revenue relying on its\\ndiscussion with respect to Question No.1. The\\nsales tax paid by the appellant was debited to a\\nseparate account titled ‘Sales Tax recoverable\\naccount’. The assessee could have set off sales\\ntax against his liability on the sales of finished\\ngoods i.e. vehicles. We do not find any infirmity\\nin the view of the High Court answering the above\\nquestion.\\n33. The next submission which has been advanced by\\nShri Ganesh is on the first proviso to Section\\n43B. It has been submitted that Return for the\\nassessment year in question was to be filed before\\n30.09.1999 and unutilised credit in fact was fully\\nutilised by 30.04.1999 itself. It is submitted30\\nthat since the unutilised credit was utilised for\\npayment of Excise Duty on the manufactured\\nvehicles, the said amount ought to have been\\nallowed as permissible deduction under Section\\n43B.\\n34. The proviso to Section 43B provides that\\nnothing contained in the Section shall apply in\\nrelation to any sum which is actually paid by\\nassessee on or before due date applicable in his\\ncase for furnishing the return in respect of the\\nprevious year in which the liability to pay such\\nsum was incurred. The crucial words in the proviso\\nto Section 43B are “in respect of the previous\\nyear in which the liability to pay such sum was\\nincurred”. The proviso takes care of the situation\\nwhen liability to pay a sum has incurred but could\\nnot be paid in the year in question and has been\\npaid in the next financial year before the date of31\\nsubmission of the Return. In the present case,\\nthere was no liability to adjust the unutilised\\nMODVAT credit in the year in question since had\\nthere been liability to pay Excise Duty by the\\nappellant on manufacture of vehicles, the\\nunutilised MODVAT credit could have been adjusted\\nagainst the payment of such Excise Duty. In the\\npresent case, the liability to pay Excise Duty of\\nthe assessee is incurred on the removal of\\nfinished goods in the subsequent year i.e. year\\nbeginning from 01.04.1999 and what we are\\nconcerned with is unutilised MODVAT Credit as on\\n31.03.1999 on which date the asseessee was not\\nliable to pay any more Excise Duty. Hence, present\\nis not a case where appellant can claim benefit of\\nproviso to Section 43B. The submissions of Shri\\nGanesh on proviso to Section 43B also does not\\nsupport his claim.\\n35. In view of the foregoing discussions, we are32\\nof the view that High Court has correctly answered\\nboth the questions against the assessee\\xadappellant\\nand in favour of the Revenue. Consequently, the\\nappeals are dismissed.\\n.................J.\\n[ ASHOK BHUSHAN ]\\n.................J.\\n[ NAVIN SINHA ]\\nNEW DELHI,\\nFEBRUARY 07, 2020.',\n",

The appellant was the plaintiff and the respondent was the defendant\\nin the suit and shall be hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff and the\\ndefendant respectively.\\n5. The subject matter of the suit is the property under Survey No. 35\\nSub Division 3/17/4 admeasuring 25 Ares situated at Mauje Padave Wadi,\\nDistrict Ratnagiri. The said property shall be hereinafter referred to as the\\nsuit property. The suit property is a part of the larger property belonging to\\nRamchandra Athale. The case of the plaintiff is that Rajaram Athale had\\nexecuted a Power of Attorney in favour of her husband Ramesh Bhatkar,\\nand based on the said Power of Attorney, by deed of Sale dated 31st May,\\n2005, Ramesh Bhatkar sold the suit property to the plaintiff.\\n2 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\n6. The plaintiff claims that the defendant had purchased a portion of the\\nlarger property by Deed of Sale dated 29th February, 1992. The property\\npurchased by the defendant is surveyed under Survey No. 35 sub division\\n3/17A/1/4 and it admeasures 1 Hectare 5 Ares. The grievance of the\\nplaintiff is that Ramchandra Athale and the defendant executed a Deed of\\nRectification dated 18th October, 2005 whereby they rectified the sale deed\\ndated 29th February, 1992. Under the garb of the said deed of rectification,\\nthey changed the description of the property, which was sold to the\\ndefendant by Sale Deed dated 29th February, 1992 in such a manner as to\\ninclude the suit property within the boundaries of the property purchased by\\nthe defendant.\\n7. The plaintiff claims that subsequent to the execution of the Deed of\\nRectification, the defendant objected to the mutation entry in favour of the\\nplaintiff. The defendant got her name recorded in the 7 x 12 extract and\\nstarted disturbing and interfering with her possession in respect of the suit\\nproperty. Based on these pleadings, the plaintiff filed a suit seeking relief\\nof permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from disturbing or\\ninterfering with her possession in respect of the suit property.\\n3 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\n8. The defendant contested the claim of the plaintiff mainly on the\\nground that she had purchased the entire property admeasuring 1 Hectare 1\\nAres from Ramchandra Athale by Deed of Sale dated 29th February, 1992.\\nThe defendant denied that Ramchandra Athale had executed any Power of\\nAttorney in favour of Ramesh Bhatkar, the husband of the plaintiff or that\\nsaid Ramchandra Athale had authorized Ramesh Bhatkar to execute any\\nsale deed in favour of the plaintiff. The defendant further claimed that\\nRamchandra Athale or his Power of Attorney could not have executed any\\nsale deed in favour of the plaintiff since the title in respect of the entire\\nproperty was already transferred in her favour by Deed of Sale dated 29th\\nFebruary, 1992. The defendant claimed that she is the owner in possession\\nof the suit property and contended that the plaintiff has no right to the suit\\nproperty.\\n9. Based on these pleadings, the learned trial Judge framed the\\nfollowing issues:-\\n(i) Whether the plaintiff proves that she is the owner in\\npossession of the suit property?\\n(ii) Whether the plaintiff has proved that the defendant has\\ninterfered with her possession in respect of the suit property.\\n4 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\n(iii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the relief of\\npermanent injunction?\\n10. Both the parties adduced evidence in support of their respective\\nclaims. After appreciating the evidence on record, the learned trial Judge\\nheld that the plaintiff had proved that she was the owner in possession of\\nthe suit property and that the defendant was interfering with her possession.\\nThe learned trial Judge therefore answered the issues in the affirmative and\\ndecreed the suit as prayed.\\n11. The defendant challenged the said judgment and decree in Regular\\nCivil Appeal No.21 of 2010. The learned District Judge held that the\\ndefendant had disputed the title of the plaintiff in respect of the suit\\nproperty, despite which the plaintiff had not sought a declaratory relief.\\nRelying upon the decision of the Apex Court in Anathulla Sudhakar vs. P.\\nBuchi Reddy1 the learned Judge held that the suit for injunction simplicitor\\nwas not maintainable.\\n12. The learned Judge further held that there was also dispute regarding\\nidentification of the suit property and hence it was not possible to ascertain\\n1 AIR 2008 SC 2033\\n5 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nas to which of the party was in possession of the suit property. The learned\\nJudge further held that the defendant had also disputed that the owner Shri\\nRamchandra Athale had executed a Power of Attorney in favour of the\\nhusband of the plaintiff and despite such pleading issue in that regard was\\nnot framed. Based on these findings, the learned District Judge I, Ratnagiri\\nset aside and quashed the impugned judgment and remanded the suit for re-\\ntrial, with liberty to the plaintiff to amend the plaint so as to seek\\ndeclaration of his title, if so desired. The learned District Judge directed\\nthe trial Court to frame issue regarding the validity of the Power of\\nAttorney and also to appoint the Taluka Inspector of Land Record (T.I.L.R.)\\nas Court Commissioner. The learned Judge further directed the T.I.L.R. to\\ntake measurement of survey no. 35 and to identify the suit property and\\ndelineate the same on a plan.\\n13. Aggrieved by the order of remand, the plaintiff has filed this appeal.\\nSince the plaintiff has questioned the legality of the order of remand, it is\\nnecessary to consider the scope of jurisdiction of the Appellate Court in the\\nmatter of remand. Rules 23, 23A, 24 and 25 of Order 41 of Civil Procedure\\nCode (for short CPC), which govern the powers of the appellate Court in\\n6 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nthe matter of remand rules read thus:\\n23. Remand of case by Appellate Court - Where the Court\\nfrom whose decree an appeal is preferred has disposed of the\\nsuit upon a preliminary point and the decree is reversed in\\nappeal, the Appellate Court may, if it thinks fit, by order\\nremand the case, and may further direct what issue or issues\\nshall be tried in the case so remanded, and shall send a copy\\nof its judgment and order to the Court from whose decree the\\nappeal is preferred, which directions to re-admit the suit\\nunder its original number in the register of civil suits, and\\nproceed to determine the suit; and the evidence (if any)\\nrecorded during the original trial shall, subject to all just\\nexceptions, be evidence during the trial after remand.\\n23A. Remand in other cases - Where the Court from whose\\ndecree an appeal is preferred has disposed of the case\\notherwise than on a preliminary point, and the decree is\\nreversed in appeal and a retrial is considered necessary, the\\nAppellate Court shall have the same powers as it has under\\nrule 23.\\n24. Where evidence on record sufficient, Appellate Court\\nmay determine case finally- Where the evidence upon the\\nrecord is sufficient to enable the appellate court to pronounce\\njudgment, the Appellate court, may after re-settling the\\nissues, if necessary, finally determine the suit,\\nnotwithstanding that the judgment of the court from whose\\ndecree the appeal is preferred has proceeded wholly upon\\nsome ground other than that on which the Appellate Court\\nproceeds.\\n25. Where Appellate Court may frame issues and refer them\\nfor trial to court whose decree appealed from - Where the\\ncourt from whose decree the appeal is preferred has omitted\\nto frame or try any issue, or to determine any question of\\nfact, which appears to the Appellate Court essential to the\\nright decision of the suit upon the merits, the Appellate Court\\n7 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nmay, if necessary, frame issues, and refer the same for trial to\\nthe court from whose decree the appeal is preferred and in\\nsuch case shall direct such court to take the additional\\nevidence required; and such court shall proceed to try such\\nissues, and shall return the evidence to the Appellate Court\\ntogether with its findings thereon and the reasons there for\\nwithin such time as may be fixed by the Appellate Court or\\nextended by it from time to time.\\n14. A plain reading of the aforesaid provisions make it abundantly clear\\nthat the scope of remand in terms of Order 41 Rule 23 CPC is very limited.\\nThe Appellate court can invoke the powers under Rule 23 of Order 41 only\\nwhen the trial Court has disposed of the suit on a preliminary point and\\nwhen the Appellate Court reverses such decree and considers it fit to\\nremand the case for fresh disposal.\\nOrder 41 Rule 23A, which has been inserted in the Code by Act No.\\n104 of 1976, empowers the Appellate Court to remand the suit to the trial\\nCourt, when the suit is disposed of otherwise than on a preliminary point\\nand the decree is reversed in appeal and retrial is considered necessary.\\nOrder 41 Rule 24 enables the Appellate Court to resettle the issues if\\nnecessary and determine the suit finally on the basis of the evidence\\navailable on record, if such evidence is sufficient to pronounce judgment.\\nThe object of this provision is to obviate delay and ensure finality to the\\n8 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nproceedings.\\nOrder 41 Rule 25 of the Code empowers the Appellate Court to frame\\nissues and refer them for trial to the Court from whose decree the appeal is\\npreferred. The powers under Rule 25 can be invoked by the Appellate\\nCourt when the Court that passed the decree has omitted to frame or try any\\nissue, or to determine any question of fact, essential to decide the suit upon\\nthe merits. While remitting the issues, the Appellate Court is empowered to\\ndirect the trial Court to take additional evidence on such issues. When\\nissues are remitted in exercise of powers under Order 41 Rule 25 of the\\nCourt, the Appellate Court continues to be in seisin of the matter . In such\\ncase, the trial Court has to try the issues referred by the Appellate Court and\\nreturn the evidence to the Appellate Court together with its findings and\\nreasons thereon. The Appellate Court thereafter has to decide the appeal\\non the additional evidence and additional findings recorded by the trial\\ncourt.\\n15. The powers of remand conferred on the Appellate Court can be\\nexercised only in accordance with the above-referred provisions. It is also\\nwell settled that the Appellate Court should be circumspect in ordering a\\n9 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nremand as it is well known that unwarranted order of remand results in\\nprolonged litigation and consequent manifest injustice to the litigants. In\\nthis regard, it would be advantageous to refer to the decision of the Apex\\nCourt in P. Purshottam Reddy & Anr. v. Pratap Steels Ltd.2 wherein the\\nApex Court has held as under:-\\nThe next question to be examined is the legality and propriety\\n“\\nof the order of remand made by the High Court. Prior to the\\ninsertion of Rule 23A in Order 41 of the Code of Civil\\nProcedure by CPC Amendment Act 1976, there were only two\\nprovisions contemplating remand by a court of appeal in Order\\n41 of CPC. Rule 23 applies when the trial court disposes of the\\nentire suit by recording its findings on a preliminary issue\\nwithout deciding other issues and the finding on preliminary\\nissue is reversed in appeal. Rule 25 applies when the appellate\\ncourt notices an omission on the part of the trial court to frame\\nor try any issue or to determine any question of fact which in\\nthe opinion of the appellate court was essential to the right\\ndecision of the suit upon the merits. However, the remand\\ncontemplated by Rule 25 is a limited remand in as much as the\\nsubordinate court can try only such issues as are referred to it\\nfor trial and having done so, the evidence recorded, together\\nwith findings and reasons therefore of the trial court, are\\nrequired to be returned to the appellate court. However, still it\\nwas a settled position of law before 1976 Amendment that the\\ncourt, in a appropriate case could exercise its inherent\\njurisdiction under Section 151 of the CPC to order a remand if\\nsuch a remand was considered pre-eminently necessary ex\\ndebito justitiate, though not covered by any specific provision\\nof Order 41 of the CPC. In cases where additional evidence is\\nrequired to be taken in the event of any one of the clauses of\\nsub-rule (1) of Rule 27 being attracted, such additional\\nevidence oral or documentary, is allowed to be produced either\\n2 AIR 2002 SC 771\\n10 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nbefore the appellate court itself or by directing any court\\nsubordinate to the appellate court to receive such evidence and\\nsend it to the appellate court. In 1976, Rule 23 A has been\\ninserted in Order 41 which provides for a remand by an\\nappellate court hearing an appeal against a decree if (i) the\\ntrial court disposed of the case otherwise than on a\\npreliminary point, and (ii) the decree is reversed in appeal and\\na retrial is considered necessary. On twin conditions being\\nsatisfied, the appellate court can exercise the same power of\\nremand under Rule 23A as it is under Rule 23. After the\\namendment, all the cases of wholesale remand are covered by\\nRule 23 and 23 A. In view of the express provision of these\\nrules, the High Court cannot have recourse to its inherent\\npowers to make a remand because, as held in Mahendra v.\\nSushila, AIR (1965) SC 365, at p. 399), it is well settled that\\ninherent powers can be availed of ex debito justiatiate only in\\nthe absence of express provisions in the Code. It is only in\\nexceptional cases where the court may now exercise the power\\nof remand de hors the Rules 23 and 23A. To wit, the superior\\ncourt, if it finds that the judgment under appeal has not\\ndisposed of the case satisfactorily in the manner required by\\nOrder 20 Rule 3 or Order 41 Rule 31 of the CPC and hence it\\nis no judgment in the eye of law, it may set aside the same and\\nsend the matter back for re-writing the judgment so as to\\nprotect valuable rights of the parties,. An appellate court\\nshould be circumspect in ordering a remand when the case is\\nnot covered either by Rule 23 or Rule 23A or Rule 25 of the\\nCPC. An unwarranted order of remand gives the litigation an\\nundeserved lease of life and, therefore, must be avoided.”\\n16. Similarly, in the case of Municipal Corporation, Hyderabad vs.\\nSundersingh3 the Apex Court has held thus:-\\n11. It is now well settled that before invoking the said\\nprovision, the conditions precedent laid down therein must be\\n3 [2008] 8 SCC 485\\n11 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nsatisfied. It is further well settled that the court should loathe\\nto exercise its power in terms of Order XLI Rule 23 of the\\nCode of Civil Procedure and an order of remand should not\\nbe passed routinely. It is not to be exercised by the appellate\\ncourt only because it finds it difficult to deal with the entire\\nmatter. If it does not agree with the decision of the trial court,\\nit has to come with a proper finding of its own. The appellate\\ncourt cannot shirk its duties.\\n17. The validity of the impugned order of remand has to be tested on the\\ntouchstone of the relevant provisions and the above stated well-settled\\nprinciples governing power of remand.\\n18. It is not in dispute that in the instant case the provisions of Order 41\\nRule 23 were not attracted. The Appellate Court had also not taken\\nrecourse to Order 41 Rule 25 of CPC. The learned Judge, in exercise of the\\npowers under Rule 23 A CPC, quashed and set aside the judgment and\\ndecree whilst directing the trial court to decide the matter afresh. A careful\\nscrutiny of the impugned judgment reveals that the Appellate Court has\\nconsidered the retrial necessary for the following reasons:-\\n(i) That the plaintiff had not sought declaratory relief even\\nthough the defendant had challenged her title in respect of the\\nsuit property.\\n(ii) That the issue regarding validity of the Power of\\n12 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nAttorney was not framed and\\n(iii) That the suit property was not properly identified.\\n19. The foremost question is whether the learned Judge was justified in\\nremanding the suit for retrial with liberty to the plaintiff to amend the plaint\\nas to seek a declaratory relief. As stated earlier, the plaintiff had claimed to\\nbe the owner in possession of the suit property by virtue of sale deed dated\\n31st May, 2005. The plaintiff had filed the suit for permanent injunction\\nalleging that the defendant was interfering with her possession in respect of\\nthe suit property. The defendant in her written statement raised a defence\\nthat she had already purchased the entire property including the suit\\nproperty by Deed of Sale dated 29th February, 1992. In short, the defendant\\nclaimed to be the owner of the suit property. It was in the light of these\\naverments that the learned Judge had granted liberty to the plaintiff to\\namend the plaint as to incorporate a declaratory relief.\\n20. It is pertinent to note that the suit was filed in the month of January\\n2006 and the written statement, disclosing the defence was filed\\nimmediately thereafter. The liberty to amend the plaint as to seek\\ndeclaratory relief has been given in the year 2016. While granting such\\n13 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nliberty, the learned Judge neither considered the question whether the\\ndeclaratory relief was barred by the law of limitation nor heard the\\ndefendant on the said issue.\\n21. The learned Judge has ordered re-trail by granting liberty to the\\nplaintiff to amend the plaint and seek a declaratory relief, mainly on the\\nground that the suit for injunction simplicitor was not maintainable. As\\nregards the maintainability of the suit for injunction simplicitor, in the\\nabsence of relief for declaration and or possession, the Apex Court in\\nAnathulla Sudhakar (supra) has held as under:\\n11.1) Where a plaintiff is in lawful or peaceful possession of\\na property and such possession is interfered or threatened by\\nthe defendant, a suit for an injunction simpliciter will lie. A\\nperson has a right to protect his possession against any\\nperson who does not prove a better title by seeking a\\nprohibitory injunction. But a person in wrongful possession\\nis not entitled to an injunction against the rightful owner.\\n11.2) Where the title of the plaintiff is not disputed, but he is\\nnot in possession, his remedy is to file a suit for possession\\nand seek in addition, if necessary, an injunction. A person out\\nof possession, cannot seek the relief of injunction simpliciter,\\nwithout claiming the relief of possession.\\n11.3) Where the plaintiff is in possession, but his title to the\\nproperty is in dispute, or under a cloud, or where the\\ndefendant asserts title thereto and there is also a threat of\\ndispossession from defendant, the plaintiff will have to sue\\nfor declaration of title and the consequential relief of\\ninjunction. Where the title of plaintiff is under a cloud or in\\n14 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\ndispute and he is not in possession or not able to establish\\npossession, necessarily the plaintiff will have to file a suit for\\ndeclaration, possession and injunction.\\n12. We may however clarify that a prayer for declaration will\\nbe necessary only if the denial of title by the defendant or\\nchallenge to plaintiff's title raises a cloud on the title of\\nplaintiff to the property. A cloud is said to raise over a\\nperson's title, when some apparent defect in his title to a\\nproperty, or when some prima facie right of a third party\\nover it, is made out or shown. An action for declaration, is\\nthe remedy to remove the cloud on the title to the property.\\nOn the other hand, where the plaintiff has clear title\\nsupported by documents, if a trespasser without any claim to\\ntitle or an interloper without any apparent title, merely\\ndenies the plaintiff's title, it does not amount to raising a\\ncloud over the title of the plaintiff and it will not be necessary\\nfor the plaintiff to sue for declaration and a suit for\\ninjunction may be sufficient. Where the plaintiff, believing\\nthat defendant is only a trespasser or a wrongful claimant\\nwithout title, files a mere suit for injunction, and in such a\\nsuit, the defendant discloses in his defence the details of the\\nright or title claimed by him, which raises a serious dispute\\nor cloud over plaintiff's title, then there is a need for the\\nplaintiff, to amend the plaint and convert the suit into one for\\ndeclaration. Alternatively, he may withdraw the suit for bare\\ninjunction, with permission of the court to file a\\ncomprehensive suit for declaration and injunction. He may\\nfile the suit for declaration with consequential relief, even\\nafter the suit for injunction is dismissed, where the suit raised\\nonly the issue of possession and not the issue of title.”\\n22. In the instant case, the plaintiff, who is the dominus litus, was aware\\nof the defence as disclosed in the written statement, despite which the\\nplaintiff had not filed an application for amendment either before the trial\\n15 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\ncourt or before the District Court seeking leave to amend the plaint as to\\nseek a declaratory relief. Even before this Court, the stand taken by the\\nplaintiff is that the pleadings as well as the evidence on record sufficiently\\nproves her title and possession in respect of the suit property. In short, the\\nplaintiff has chosen not to amend the plaint on the premise that there is no\\ndefect or cloud on her title. The plaintiff proceeded with the suit knowing\\nfully well the defence raised by the defendant and the issues involved in the\\nsuit. In such circumstances, the question, if any, regarding the\\nmaintainability of the suit for permanent injunction simplicitor, in the\\nabsence of a prayer of declaration of title, was required to be decided based\\non the pleadings and evidence on record, keeping in mind the aforesaid\\nprinciples in this regard. In other words, the learned Judge was required to\\ndecide the appeal on its own merits on the basis of the pleadings and\\nevidence on record.\\n23. Under the circumstances, the learned Judge was not justified in\\nremanding the suit by granting liberty to the plaintiff to amend the plaint as\\nto seek declaratory relief, without there being any such application or\\nprayer for amendment and further without considering the question of\\n16 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nlimitation and hearing the defendant on the said issue.\\n24. As regards framing of additional issue regarding validity of Power of\\nAttorney, the learned Judge has lost sight of the fact that the judgment and\\ndecree cannot be set aside for failure to frame any issue. Even if the trial\\nCourt omits to frame an issue, Rule 24 of Order 41 enables the Appellate\\nCourt to resettle the issue and decide the appeal on the basis of the evidence\\non record if such evidence is sufficient to pronounce the judgment.\\nFurthermore, in terms of Rule 25 of Order 41 of CPC the Appellate Court\\nhas ample powers to frame such issue and refer the same for trial and\\nthereafter to decide the Appeal after considering the additional evidence\\nand findings recorded by the Trial Court on the additional issue.\\n25. Be that as it may, in the instant case, the suit filed by the plaintiff\\nwas for injunction simplicitor. Hence the only issue that was relevant to\\ndecide the suit was as to whether the plaintiff was in lawful possession of\\nthe suit property and whether the defendant was interfering or disturbing\\nher lawful possession. The learned trial Judge had already framed these\\nissues and the parties had adduced their evidence knowing fully well the\\n17 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\ncase pleaded by them and the issues involved in the suit. Hence, even if the\\nvalidity of Power of Attorney was required to be considered while deciding\\nthe issue of lawful possession, the Appellate Court could have considered\\nthe said question and recorded its finding on the basis of the evidence\\navailable on record. The learned District Judge was therefore not justified\\nin directing the learned Judge to frame the issue regarding the validity of\\nthe Power of Attorney, and further remanding the suit for framing an issue\\nregarding the validity of Power of Attorney and/or for recording evidence\\non such issue.\\n26. Now coming to the question of appointment of the Commissioner, the\\nlearned Judge has held that there was dispute as regards the identity of the\\nsuit property and hence it was not possible to arrive at any finding as to\\nwhich of the parties was in possession of the suit property. The learned\\nJudge therefore remanded the suit with direction to the trial court to appoint\\na commissioner to identify the suit property. It is to be noted that both\\nparties had adduced oral as well as documentary evidence. The learned\\nJudge has neither appreciated the evidence on record nor considered the\\nlegality of the findings rendered by the trial court. In the event the Trial\\n18 of 20\\npps\\n::: Uploaded on - 17/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:00:51 :::12- ao- jud 750-16.doc\\nCourt had not considered the question of identity of the suit property, the\\nlearned Judge could have evaluated the evidence and determined the case\\non merits in terms of Rule 24 order 41 or proceeded under rule 25 order 41\\nof the Code, as the case may be. Furthermore, if the learned Judge was of\\nthe view that the evidence on record was not sufficient to decide the case on\\nmerits and that the appointment of the Commissioner was essential to\\nenable it to pronounce the judgment or for any other substantial cause, the\\nlearned Judge, after recording the reasons, could have received additional\\nevidence under Rule 27 of Order 41 of CPC, keeping in mind the well\\nsettled principles governing reception of additional evidence; enunciated by\\nthe Constitutional Bench of the Apex Court in K. Venkatramiah vs.A.\\nSeetharama Reddy4 , and reiterated in Surjit Singh vs. Gurwant Kaur5. In\\nthe instant case the learned Judge has not undertaken any such exercise and\\nhas remanded the suit mechanically, ignoring the relevant provisions\\nrelating to remand and has thus subjected the parties to a long-drawn and\\nunwinding litigation. The order of remand therefore cannot be sustained.\\n27. Under these circumstances and in view of discussion supra, the\\nappeal is allowed.

The collision\\nbetween Tempo and Alto resulted in the death of Sudam on the spot\\nand injuries to the two other occupants in the Alto. Sudam was 46\\nyears old at the time of his unfortunate demise in the accident. He\\nwas working as Manager in Patalganga Plant of Reliance Industries\\nand drawing monthly salary of Rs.52,000/\\xad apart from several other\\nperquisites. The MACT, by the impugned award, has directed the\\nowner and insurer of the Tempo to pay compensation of\\nRs.71,36,917/\\xad (excluding amount of Rs.50,000/\\xad towards no fault\\nliability) together with interest at the rate of 7% per annum from\\nthe date of the claim petition till realization. Aggrieved by the\\nimpugned judgment and award, the appellant Insurance Company\\nhas instituted the present appeal.\\n4] Ms.Mital, learned counsel for the appellant, submits\\nthat this was a case of head on collision between two motor vehicles\\npage 2 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\non a broad wide road. She submits that the material on record\\nmakes out a case of contributory negligence on the part of deceased\\nSudam, who was driving Alto. She submits that the material on\\nrecord establishes that Alto was overloaded and being driven in a\\nrash and negligent manner. She submits that the evidence on record\\nestablishes that Sudam was speaking on mobile phone and driving\\nthe Alto with only one hand to control the steering. She, therefore,\\nsubmits that the compensation awarded, which is even otherwise\\nvery excessive, is required to be scaled down by at least 50%, since,\\nthe deceased Sudam, contributed to the accident to the extent of\\n50%.

She submits that the evidence\\non record, at the highest, suggest that the total income of Sudam\\nwas Rs.5,25,910/\\xad per annum and the MACT has erred in treating\\nsuch annual income at Rs.7,46,592/\\xad. She submits that from out of\\nthe annual income of Rs.5,25,910/\\xad, an amount of Rs.1,09,928/\\xad\\nwas required to be deducted towards income tax. She submits that\\nthe amount of annual income includes certain perquisite, which\\nwere exclusive to Sudam and therefore, some suitable deductions\\nare warranted from annual income. She submits that the net income\\nof Sudam on the basis of evidence on record, cannot exceed Rs.4\\nlakhs per annum. She submits that the MACT, has grossly erred in\\ntaking the annual income of Sudam at Rs.8,24,413/\\xad and\\ndetermining the compensation on the said basis. She submits that\\neven on this score the compensation awarded by the MACT is\\nrequired to be reduced to Rs.35 lakhs in place of Rs.71,86,917/\\xad as\\ndetermined by the MACT. She submits that no proper deductions\\nhave been made towards personal expenses, income tax or personal\\nperquisites. She relied upon certain decisions in support of\\ndetermination of quantum of compensation in such matters.\\npage 4 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\n6] Mr.Gokhale, learned counsel for the respondents\\xad\\nclaimants, submits that the accident in the present case took place\\nentirely on account of negligence on the part of Tempo driver, who\\nwas driving tempo at the very high speed in a rash and negligent\\nmanner. He submits that there is absolutely no material on record\\nto suggest any contributory negligence. He submits that the MACT\\nhas carefully assessed the material on record and rightly rejected the\\ncontentions based upon the alleged overloading of vehicle, over\\nspeeding or driving with one hand and using the other for speaking\\non the mobile phone. He submits that in this case prosecution was\\nlaunched against the Tempo driver and in the prosecution so\\nlaunched, even the State, has not hinted any contributory negligence\\non the part of deceased Sudam.

He\\nsubmits that the MACT has unnecessarily deducted certain amounts\\nfrom the annual income of Sudam and this has resulted in\\ndetermination of compensation, which is less than just and\\nreasonable. Besides, he submits that in this case award of\\nRs.12,000/\\xad towards loss of consortium, Rs.30,000/\\xad towards loss of\\nestate and love and affection and Rs.2000/\\xad towards funeral\\nexpenses is totally inadequate and in fact contrary to the decisions\\nin cases of Smt.

He\\nsubmits that the compensation under the said heads was required to\\nbe at least Rs.10 lakhs and not Rs.42,000/\\xad as determined by the\\nMACT. Mr. Gokhale submits that it is a fit case where the\\ncompensation amount awarded by the MACT by the impugned\\njudgment and award is liable to be enhanced by this court. Mr.\\nGokhale therefore, submits that this appeal may be dismissed, but\\nthe compensation amount may be enhanced to Rs.1 crore as prayed\\nfor by the claimants in the claim petition.

Sudam was driving Alto from Rajuri\\ntowards Ozar. The Tempo, which was insured by the appellant came\\nfrom the opposite direction and dashed the Alto, resulting in demise\\nof Sudam. The parties have lead both oral as well as documentary\\nevidence as to the circumstances of the accident. There is also no\\ndispute that the criminal prosecution was launched by the State\\nagainst the driver of the Tempo alleging rashness and negligence.\\nHowever, the final out come of prosecution is not reflected from the\\nrecord.\\n11] As held by the MACT, there is no evidence to sustain\\nany finding of contributory negligence. In particular, there is no\\nevidence that the Alto was carrying passengers in excess of\\nprescribed limit or that Alto was being driven at some speed\\nexceeding some permissible limit. There is also no evidence that\\nSudam was speaking on the mobile phone and the car was being\\ndriven with only one hand on the steering. Ms Mital is not justified\\nin her criticism, when she urged that the MACT has in fact approved\\npage 8 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\ndriving of the car with only one hand on the steering. The MACT,\\nhas in fact held that there is no evidence to sustain any inference\\nthat Sudam was speaking on the mobile phone and driving the Alto\\nwith one hand only. The MACT has rightly referred to spot\\npanchanama and noted the absence of any such mobile phone from\\nthe scene of accident. The MACT has also made reference to the\\ndeposition of DW\\xad1 Mansur, who had also not made any reference to\\nany mobile phone in the hand of Sudam. After recording a\\ncategorical finding of fact that Sudam was not speaking on the\\nmobile phone, at the time of accident, the MACT, by way of demurer\\nmade an observation that there is no rule, which bars a driver from\\nretaining the right hand on the steering wheel and changing gears\\nwith his left hand. This is merely an observation by way of demurer.\\nMs Mital, on the basis of material on record, was unable to make out\\na case that Sudam was indeed negligent or that Sudam contributed\\nto the negligence, which ultimately resulted in the accident and\\ndemise of Sudam. The material on record does establish that the\\naccident took place on account of negligence of the Tempo driver.\\nThe oral and documentary evidence on record does not support the\\ntheory of any contributory negligence. The spot panchanama,\\ndamage to the vehicles, the circumstance that the Tempo was a\\nheavier vehicle weighing 5500 Kgs as compared to Alto which\\npage 9 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\nweighed about 750 Kgs, are all relevant pieces of evidence, which\\nhave been appropriately considered by the MACT in concluding that\\nthe accident took place on account of negligence of the Tempo\\ndriver and Sudam, in no manner, contributed to the negligence.\\n12] The decisions relied upon by Ms Mittal basically turn on\\ntheir own facts. In Kunjamma Mathai (supra), the collision was\\nbetween a mini bus and motor cycle. The evidence on record\\nestablished that the motorcyclist on the main road took a turn\\ntowards his right to go to a secondary road without giving signal.\\nThe Tempo dashed the motorcycle and it is in these circumstances\\nthat negligence was apportioned at 60% upon the motorcyclist and\\n40% upon the Tempo driver. No such circumstances are brought on\\nrecord in the present case and therefore, the decision in case of\\nKunjamma Mathai (supra), is inapplicable.\\n13] Similarly, in Ushakiran Shinde (supra), learned Single\\nJudge of this Court has held that the plea of contributory negligence\\ncannot be regarded as proved merely on basis of certain\\nobservations in the panchanama, more particularly when the\\ncontents of the panchanama were never proved. This decision hardly\\nassists the appellant in establishing the plea of contributory\\npage 10 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\nnegligence. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Kamalabai (supra),\\nthere was head on collision between a Matador and Truck on a road\\nwhose width was enough for the two vehicles to pass. In the facts\\nand circumstance as established, this Court held that the drivers of\\nboth the vehicles were proceeding at high speed and contributed to\\nnegligence. No such facts have been established in the present case.\\n14] In Anand R. Raikar (supra), there was eye witness's\\nevidence that the scooterist came from village road to the highway\\nand was dashed by a taxi. On basis of established facts, this court\\nheld that the deceased scooterist ought to have looked on both sides\\nbefore entering upon highway from the village road and therefore,\\ncontributed to negligence to the extent of 75%. Again, such facts do\\nnot obtain in the present case and therefore, the decision in Anand\\nRaikar (supra), is of no assistance to the appellant.\\n15] Accordingly, there is no merit in the contention of\\nMs Mittal that deceased Sudam contributed to negligence, which\\nresulted in accident and demise of Sudam.\\n16] There is no dispute that deceased Sudam was working\\nas a Manager Lab/Process in Patalganga Plant at Reliance Industries.\\npage 11 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\nThere is both documentary as well as oral evidence with regard to\\nsalary and emoluments drawn by Sudam at the time of his demise in\\nthe accident which has given rise to the claim in this proceedings.\\nThe gross salary as per the income tax returns for the financial year\\n2005\\xad2006 comes to Rs.6,16,969/\\xad. The MACT has added an\\namount of Rs.1,29,623/\\xad towards perquisites. However, such\\naddition in its entirety appears to be excessive. The material on\\nrecord indicates that at least 50% of such amount relates to\\ntravelling expenses, which, in the facts and circumstances of the\\npresent case, will have to be regarded as personal to Sudam. The\\naddition of Rs.65000/\\xad, i.e., approximately 50% of Rs.1,29,623/\\xad,\\nappears to be proper in the facts and circumstances of the present\\ncase. This means that the gross annual income of Sudam can be\\ntaken as Rs.6,81,969/\\xad. Out of this, amount of Rs.1,09,928/\\xad will\\nhave to be deducted towards income tax, so as to assess the net\\nincome at Rs.5,72,041/\\xad. In terms of the law laid down by the\\nHon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma (supra), the addition of 30%\\nis due to the net annual income, since, Sudam was about 46 years at\\nthe time of his demise. This means that the annual income of\\nSudam, for the purposes of assessment of compensation, will have to\\nbe taken as Rs.7,62,724/\\xad and not Rs.8,24,413/\\xad as held by the\\nMACT.\\npage 12 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\n17] The MACT has deducted 1/3rd amount towards personal\\nexpenses. In this case, Sudam was survived by his widow, two\\nchildren and two parents, i.e., Sudam was survived by five\\ndependents. Shri. Shripatrao Auti, Sudam's father has expired\\nduring pendency of proceedings before the MACT. The deduction\\ntowards personal expenses, in such circumstances, could be taken as\\n1/4th and not 1/3rd as held by the MACT. This means that the annual\\ndependency comes to Rs.5,72,041/\\xad. Further, considering that\\nSudam was 46 years old at the time of accident and demise, the\\nmultiplier in terms of Sarla Verma (supra), will have to be correctly\\ntaken as 13. The MACT has correctly taken the multiplier as 13. The\\ntotal compensation towards dependency would therefore, be\\nRs.5,72,041 X 13 = Rs.74,36,533/\\xad.\\n18] Besides aforesaid, the compensation of Rs.1 lakh is\\npayable to Seema, i.e., Sudam's widow for loss of consortium. The\\ntwo children of Sudam also entitled to compensation of Rs.1 lakh\\neach towards loss of love and affection on account of demise of their\\nfather Sudam. Similarly, Sudam's mother Tarabai is also entitled to\\ncompensation of Rs.50,000/\\xad towards loss of love and affection on\\naccount of demise of Sudam. The compensation of Rs.25,000/\\xad is\\npage 13 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\ndue and payable towards funeral expenses. This means that\\nadditional compensation of Rs.3,75,000/\\xad is due and payable to the\\nclaimants.\\n19] Thus, just and reasonable compensation, in the facts\\nand circumstances of the present case is required to be assessed at\\nRs.78,11,533/\\xad in place of Rs.71,36,917/\\xad as determined by the\\nMACT.\\n20] In Nagappa vs. Gurudayal Singh and ors.\\xad (2003) 2\\nSCC 274, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that it is the duty of\\nthe claims tribunal as well as the appeal court to determine and\\naward just and reasonable compensation and that such duty is\\nstatutory irrespective of whether claim has been made in respect\\nthereof or not.\\n21] In Nagappa (supra), the Hon’ble Supreme Court after\\nreference to several provisions of the M.V. Act has held as follows:\\n“9. It appears that due importance is not given to sub\\xad\\nsection (4) of Section 166 which provides that the Tribunal\\nshall treat any report of the accidents forwarded to it under\\nsub\\xadsection (6) of Section 158, as an application for\\ncompensation under this Act.\\n10. Thereafter, Section 168 empowers the Claims Tribunal\\npage 14 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\nto “make an award determining the amount of\\ncompensation which appears to it to be just”. Therefore, the\\nonly requirement for determining the compensation is that it\\nmust be “just”. There is no other limitation or restriction on\\nits power for awarding just compensation.\\n11. Secondly, under Section 169, the Claims Tribunal in\\nholding any inquiry under Section 168 is required to follow\\nthe rules that are made in this behalf and follow such\\nsummary procedure as it thinks fit. In the present case, it\\nhas been pointed out that Rule 253 of the Karnataka Motor\\nVehicles Rules, 1989 empowers the Claims Tribunal to\\nexercise all or any of the powers vested in a civil court under\\nthe provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Rule 254\\ninter alia makes specific provision that Order 6 Rule 17 CPC\\nis applicable to such proceedings. In this view of the matter,\\nin an appropriate case, depending upon the facts and the\\nevidence which has been brought on record and in the\\ninterest of justice, the court may permit amendment of claim\\npetition so as to award enhanced compensation. Further, for\\namendment of the pleadings, it is settled law that unless it\\ncauses injustice to the other side or it is not necessary for the\\npurpose of determining the real issue between the parties,\\nthe court would grant amendment. It is also to be stated that\\nunder the MV Act there is no time\\xadlimit prescribed for\\nclaiming compensation. Therefore, there is no question of\\nenhanced claim being barred by limitation.\\n12. This Court in Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd. v.\\nNorthern India Transport Insurance Co. observed as under:\\n(SCC p. 788, paras 6\\xad7)\\n“The pecuniary loss to the aggrieved party would\\ndepend upon data which cannot be ascertained\\naccurately but must necessarily be an estimate or\\neven partly a conjecture.\\n* * *\\nThe determination of the question of compensation\\ndepends on several imponderables. In the\\nassessment of those imponderables, there is likely to\\nbe a margin of error.”\\n13. Hence, as stated earlier, it is for the Tribunal to\\ndetermine just compensation from the evidence which is\\nbrought on record despite the fact that the claimant has not\\nprecisely stated the amount of damages of compensation\\npage 15 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\nwhich he is entitled to. If the evidence on record justifies\\npassing of such award, the claim cannot be rejected solely on\\nthe ground that the claimant has restricted his claim. Form\\n63 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, which is for\\nfiling an application for compensation, does not provide that\\nthe claimant should specify his claim amount. It inter alia\\nprovides that he should mention his monthly income as well\\nas the nature of injury sustained and medical certificates.\\n14. In case, where there is evidence on record justifying\\nthe enhanced compensation for the medical treatment which\\nis required because of the injury caused to a claimant due to\\nthe accident, there is no reason why such amendment or\\nenhanced compensation should not be granted. In such\\ncases, there is no question of introducing a new or\\ninconsistent cause of action. Cause of action and evidence\\nremain the same. Only question is — application of law as it\\nstands.\\n15. Mr P.K. Chakravarti, learned counsel appearing for\\nthe Insurance Company, in support of his contention that the\\nTribunal has no jurisdiction to award higher amount of\\ncompensation than what is claimed even though it is not\\nlikely to cause prejudice to the Insurance Company, heavily\\nrelied upon the decision rendered by the Full Bench of the\\nHigh Court of Gujarat in Urmila J. Sangani (Dr) v.\\nPragjibhai Mohanlal Luvana. In that case, the High Court\\nafter considering relevant decisions on the subject observed\\nthus: (AIR p. 220, para 10)\\n“We may mention that when the claimant feels that he\\nis entitled to more compensation than what is claimed\\nin the petition, it is always open to him/her to amend\\nthe claim petition and if the same is in consonance\\nwith the equity, justice and good conscience, there is no\\nreason why the Claims Tribunal should not grant\\namendment. Before compensation more than claimed is\\nawarded, the opposite parties should be put to notice,\\nthe requisite additional issue/issues should be raised\\nand the parties should be permitted to adduce their\\nevidence on the additional issues, but if no such\\nopportunity is given, the procedure would obviously\\nsuffer from material irregularity affecting the decision.”\\n16. From the aforesaid observations it cannot be held that\\nthere is a bar for the Claims Tribunal to award the\\npage 16 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\ncompensation in excess of what is claimed, particularly when\\nthe evidence which is brought on record is sufficient to pass\\nsuch award. In cases where there is no evidence on record,\\nthe court may permit such amendment and allow to raise\\nadditional issue and give an opportunity to the parties to\\nproduce relevant evidence.\\n17. In support of her contention, the learned counsel for\\nthe appellant Ms Kiran Suri referred to the decision of the\\nBombay High Court in Municipal Corpn. of Greater Bombay\\nv. Kisan Gangaram Hire wherein the Court dealt with a\\nsimilar contention and observed thus:\\n“8. What is further necessary to note is that what gives\\na cause of action for preferring an application for claim\\nfor compensation is the accident by motor vehicle or\\nvehicles and not a particular monetary loss occasioned\\nby such accident. While the compensation in all no\\xadfault\\nclaim cases is fixed and uniform, in fault claim cases the\\nlosses may vary from case to case. The particular losses\\nare merely the consequence of the accident which is the\\ncause of action. This being so, the amounts of\\ncompensation claimed are nothing but the particulars\\nof the claim made. By its very nature, further the\\namount of compensation claimed cannot always be\\ncalculated precisely. In many cases it can at best be a\\nfair estimate….”\\n18. The High Court observed that in all such cases, it is\\nnecessary to keep the doors open for the claimant to make\\nthe claims, on grounds not stated earlier or for more\\namounts under heads already specified in the application.\\n19. The aforesaid decision of the Bombay High Court was\\nrelied upon and referred to by the Orissa High Court in\\nMulla Md. Abdul Wahid v. Abdul Rahim and G.B. Pattanaik,\\nJ. (as he then was) observed that the expression “just\\ncompensation” would obviously mean what is fair, moderate\\nand reasonable and awarded in the proved circumstances of\\na particular case and the expression “which appears to it to\\nbe just” vests a wide discretion in the Tribunal in the matter\\nof determining of compensation. Thereafter, the Court\\nreferred to the decision in Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd.\\nand held that the pecuniary loss to the aggrieved party\\nwould depend upon data which cannot be ascertained\\naccurately but must necessarily be an estimate or even partly\\npage 17 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\na conjecture, and if this is so, then it will be unreasonable to\\nexpect the party to state precisely the amount of damages or\\ncompensation that it would be entitled to. The Court also\\nheld that there are no fetters on the power of the Tribunal to\\naward compensation in excess of the amount which is\\nclaimed in the application.\\n20. Similarly, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in\\nDevki Nandan Bangur v. State of Haryana observed that the\\ngrant of just and fair compensation is the statutory\\nresponsibility of the court and if, on the facts, the court finds\\nthat the claimant is entitled to higher compensation, the\\ncourt should allow the claimant to amend his prayer and\\nallow proper compensation.\\n21. For the reasons discussed above, in our view, under\\nthe MV Act, there is no restriction that the Tribunal/court\\ncannot award compensation amount exceeding the claimed\\namount. The function of the Tribunal/court is to award\\n“just” compensation which is reasonable on the basis of\\nevidence produced on record. Further, in such cases there is\\nno question of claim becoming time\\xadbarred or it cannot be\\ncontended that by enhancing the claim there would be\\nchange of cause of action. It is also to be stated that as\\nprovided under subsection (4) to Section 166, even the\\nreport submitted to the Claims Tribunal under sub\\xadsection\\n(6) of Section 158 can be treated as an application for\\ncompensation under the MV Act. If required, in appropriate\\ncases, the court may permit amendment to the claim\\npetition.”\\n22] In Managing Director, Metropolitan Transport V.\\nRamarao\\xad(2013) 5 MLJ 715, learned Single Judge of the Madras\\nHigh Court, after detailed consideration of the legal provisions as\\nwell as the precedents has held that it is the duty of the appeal court\\nto award just compensation irrespective of whether or not the same\\nmay have been claimed by the claimants or not. In Ningamma and\\nanr. vs. United India Insurance Company Limited \\xad (2009) 13\\nSCC 710, the Hon'ble Supreme Court at paragraph 34 has held that\\nsection 166 of the MV Act deals with “just compensation” and even if\\npage 18 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\nin the pleadings no specific claim was made, a party should not be\\ndeprived from getting “just compensation” in case the claimant is\\nable to make out a case under any provision of law. Needless to say,\\nthe M.V. Act is beneficial and welfare legislation. In fact, the court is\\nduty bound to award “just compensation” irrespective of the fact\\nwhether any plea was raised in respect of the claimant or not.\\n23] Applying the aforesaid principles to the facts and\\ncircumstances of the present case, the appeal will have to be\\ndismissed. However, the compensation is determined at\\nRs.78,11,533/\\xad in place of Rs.71,36,917/\\xad as determined by the\\nMACT. The appellant is therefore directed to pay compensation as\\nnow determined to the claimants. Now that children of Sudam have\\nattained majority, there is no necessity to abide by the directions as\\nregards investment of compensation amount so awarded. Rather,\\ninterest of justice will be met if the compensation amount now\\ndetermined is apportioned amongst the claimants in the following\\nmanner:\\na] Seema (widow) 45% ;\\nb] Smita (daughter) 20%;\\nc] Swapnil (son) 20%; and\\nd] Tarabai (mother) 15%.\\npage 19 of 20\\nDinesh Sherla\\n::: Uploaded on - 09/06/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2024 15:27:05 :::j-fa-1991-2011\\n24] The claimants shall be entitled to proportionate interest\\nupon the compensation amount so determined. The MACT has\\nawarded interest of 7% per annum and there is no reason to disturb\\nsuch award. The appellant shall however be entitled for credit in\\nrespect of the amounts already deposited or paid.\\n25] The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms. There\\nshall be no order as to costs.\\n26] The civil application for withdrawal is disposed of in\\nterms of the final order made in the appeal itself.\\n(M. S.

              " '1\\nReportable\\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\\nCivil Appeal No 3160 of 2020\\nDevarajan Raman .... Appellant(s)\\nVersus\\nBank of India Limited ....Respondent(s)\\nJ U D G M E N T\\nDr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J\\n1 This appeal arises from a judgment of the National Company Law Appellate\\nTribunal1 dated 30 July 2020 in Company Appeal (AT) Insolvency No 646 of\\n20202.\\n2 The issue in dispute relates to the payments of costs and expenses incurred by\\nthe Resolution Professional3. Pursuant to an email dated 4 February 2019 of the\\nrespondent, who was a financial creditor of Poonam Drums and Containers\\nPrivate Limited (the Corporate Debtor), the appellant submitted his technical\\nand financial bid on 5 February 2019 for appointment as an Interim Resolution\\nProfessional. On 8 March 2019, the respondent filed a petition under Section 7\\nof the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 20164 against the Corporate Debtor. On\\n20 September 2019, the Corporate Debtor was admitted to the insolvency\\n1 “NCLAT or appellate authority”\\n2 Mr Devarajan Raman, Resolution Professional Poonam Drums & Containers Pvt Ltd v\\nBank of India Ltd\\n3 “RP”\\n4 “IBC”2\\nresolution process by the National Company Law Tribunal5 and the appellant was\\nappointed as an Interim Resolution Professional. The order of appointment of\\nthe appellant is reflected in operative direction VI of the order of the NCLT, which\\nreads as follows:\\n“VI. That this Bench at this moment appoints Mr Devarajan\\nRaman, a registered Insolvency Resolution Professional\\nhaving Registration Number [IBBI/IPA-002/IP-\\nN00323/2017-Number 18/10928] as Interim Resolution\\nProfessional to carry out the functions as mentioned\\nunder I&B Code. The fee payable to IRP/RP shall comply\\nwith the IBBI Regulations/Circulars/Directions issued in\\nthis regard.”\\n3 On 19 December 2019, the order of the NCLT was set aside in appeal6 by the\\nNCLAT at the behest of the Directors of the Corporate Debtor. By the order of\\nthe appellate authority, the proceedings were remitted to the NCLT to decide\\nupon the fee and costs of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process7 incurred\\nby the appellant which was to be borne by the respondent as a financial creditor.\\n4 On 30 December 2019, the appellant addressed a letter to the respondent\\nenclosing a statement showing the amount payable as fee and costs. The\\namount was quantified in the amount of Rs 14,75,660 until 19 December 2019.\\nAn amount of Rs 5,66,667 was reimbursed by the respondent leaving in balance,\\naccording to the appellant, an amount of Rs 9,08,993.\\n5 The appellant moved the NCLT in an application on 17 January 2020 for\\nobtaining the release of the remaining fee and costs. The principal relief which\\nwas claimed was in the following terms:\\n\"1. That the Respondent Bank of India, be directed to make\\npayment of the CIRP cost including fees of the Applicant\\nResolution Professional as per the details furnished in the\\nAnnexure D.”\\n5 “NCLT or adjudicating authority”\\n6 Company Appeal (AT) Insolvency No 1092 of 2019\\n7 “CIRP”3\\n6 On 24 January 2020, the respondent replied to the appellant’s letter dated 30\\nDecember 2019 stating that it had verified the details of the fee and costs stated\\nby the appellant and found them in conformity with the technical and financial\\nbid based on which he had been awarded the assignment, together with the\\napproval of the Committee of Creditors8. The respondent stated that it would\\nrelease the payment to the appellant, upon receipt of an order of the NCLT. By\\nits order dated 7 February 2020, the NCLT disposed of the application in the\\nfollowing terms:\\n“MA 223/2020 is filed by the Resolution Professional for his fees.\\nOn hearing both sides, the Respondent Bank is directed to pay\\nall the expenses incurred by RP and Rs.5,00,000 /- plus GST\\ntowards the fee of the RP.\\nAccordingly, MA 223/2020 is allowed and disposed of.”\\n7 The appellant filed an appeal before the NCLAT. Among the grounds of appeal,\\nthe relevant ground of challenge is extracted below:\\n“(vi) That the abovementioned application filed by the\\nappellant was taken up and heard by the National\\nCompany Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench, on 7th February,\\n2020. On the said date, even though the appellant\\nexplained to the Hon\\'ble Bench that the financial creditor\\nhad duly accepted the fee quoted by him, and there was\\nno contest whatsoever on the part of the respondent\\nfinancial creditor to the payment of the c.i.r.p. cost\\nincurred by the appellant, including his fee, the Hon\\'ble\\nMumbai Bench proceeded to pass the impugned order\\nreducing the c.i.r.p. costs and fee quoted by the\\nappellant, without citing any reasons for the same, or\\neven noticing the appellant\\'s contentions in the said\\nregard. In fact, the respondent bank affirmed during the\\ncourse of the hearing on 7th February, 2020, that it was\\nagreeable to paying the said amount. However, the same\\nwas also disregarded, and in fact, was not even noticed in\\nthe order. Copies of the minutes of meeting between the\\nappellant and respondent financial creditor, and of the\\nother documents evidencing their agreement as to the\\nfee to be paid to the appellant, are annexed herewith and\\nmarked as Annexure - C (Collectively). Annexed as\\nAnnexure D is a statement showing the amount paid by\\nthe respondent to the appellant after the passing of the\\n8 “CoC”4\\nimpugned order, which is a sum of Rs. 7,09, 154/-. An\\namount of Rs. 1,99,839/- therefore yet remains to be\\npaid, and this is reflected in the said statement as well.”\\n8 The NCLAT, while dismissing the appeal, observed that:\\n(i) The appellant had worked for about three months as RP;\\n(ii) The expenses had been allowed in full and the consolidated amount of Rs\\n5,00,000 plus GST allowed as fee of the RP for the entire period was not\\nunreasonable; and\\n(iii) Fixation of the fee is not a business decision depending on the commercial\\nwisdom of the CoC.\\n9 Ms Anjali Sharma, counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, challenged the\\norder of the NCLAT principally on the following grounds:\\n(i) The statement of fee and expenses submitted by the appellant was in\\nterms of the technical and financial bid;\\n(ii) It was categorically stated in the letter of the appellant dated 30\\nDecember 2019 that the fourth CoC meeting held on 10 December 2019\\nhad ratified all the expenses up to 30 November 2019, after which no\\nmeeting took place;\\n(iii) The respondent, as a matter of fact, by its letter dated 24 January 2020,\\nfound, upon verification, that the fee and expenses as claimed were\\nadmissible;\\n(iv) The NCLT did not scrutinize or verify the factual position and merely\\nawarded an ad hoc figure of Rs 5,00,000 while the NCLAT has committed a\\nsimilar error on the ground that an amount of Rs 5,00,000 was found to be5\\nreasonable; and\\n(v) The appellant worked as an IRP for three months which is half the period\\nof one hundred and eighty days envisaged for completing the process.\\n10 In this backdrop, counsel submitted that in terms of the decision of this Court in\\nAlok Kaushik v Bhuvaneshwari Ramanathan9, the adjudicating authority\\nwould have jurisdiction under Section 60(5)(c) of IBC. In the present case, the\\njurisdiction has (it is urged) been improperly exercised in the sense that there\\nhas been no application of mind to the basis of the claim and the figures which\\nwere accepted by the financial creditor.\\n11 On the other hand, Mr Vadlamani Seshagiri, counsel appearing on behalf of the\\nrespondent, submitted that the appellant accepted the order of the NCLAT dated\\n19 December 2019 remitting the proceedings back to the NCLT for determining\\nthe costs and fee payable to the RP. Moreover, it was sought to be urged that\\nthe payment which has been made to the RP is commensurate with the work\\nwhich was done over a period of three months.\\n12 Responding to the above submissions, it has been urged on behalf of the\\nappellant that the appellant did not challenge the order of the NCLAT remitting\\nthe proceedings back to the NCLT for determination of the costs and fee because\\nit was not necessary for the appellant to do so. Moreover, it has been submitted\\nthat the real grievance of the appellant is that the claim has not been assessed\\nor analyzed in terms of what was agreed, when the appellant submitted his bid\\nor in terms of the circular of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India dated\\n12 June 2018.\\n9 (2021) 5 SCC 7876\\n13 At the outset, it must be noted that the jurisdiction of the adjudicating authority\\nto consider the claim of a registered valuer was considered in the judgment of\\nthis Court in Alok Kaushik (supra). In that case, the NCLT held that once the\\nCIRP was set aside, it was rendered functus officio. The order of the adjudicating\\nauthority was upheld in appeal. In that context, this Court, after adverting to the\\nprovisions of the relevant Regulations, observed as follows:\\n“19. Though the CIRP was set aside later, the claim of the\\nappellant as registered valuer related to the period when he\\nwas discharging his functions as a registered valuer appointed\\nas an incident of the CIRP. NCLT would have been justified in\\nexercising its jurisdiction under Section 60(5)(c) of the IBC and,\\nin exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the\\nConstitution, we accordingly order and direct that in a situation\\nsuch as the present case, the adjudicating authority is\\nsufficiently empowered under Section 60(5)(c) of the IBC to\\nmake a determination of the amount which is payable to an\\nexpert valuer as an intrinsic part of the CIRP costs. Regulation\\n34 of the IRP Regulations defines “insolvency resolution process\\ncost” to include the fees of other professionals appointed by the\\nRP. Whether any work has been done as claimed and if so, the\\nnature of the work done by the valuer is something which need\\nnot detain this Court, since it is purely a factual matter to be\\nassessed by the adjudicating authority.\\n14 Regulation 34 of the the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India\\n(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016\\nprovides as follows :\\n“34. Resolution professional costs.—The committee shall\\nfix the expenses to be incurred on or by the\\nresolution professional and the expenses shall\\nconstitute insolvency resolution process costs.\\nExplanation.—For the purposes of this regulation,\\n“expenses” include the fee to be paid to the\\nresolution professional, fee to be paid to insolvency\\nprofessional entity, if any, and fee to be paid to\\nprofessionals, if any, and other expenses to be\\nincurred by the resolution professional.”7\\n15 The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India has issued a circular on 12 June\\n2018. The circular, inter alia, requires the insolvency professional to ensure that\\nthe fees payable to him during the CIRP are reasonable and the approval of the\\nCoC for the fee or other expenses is obtained, wherever approval is required.\\n16 In the present case, after the NCLAT set aside the order of the NCLT initiating the\\nCIRP, the proceedings were remitted back for determining the insolvency\\nresolution costs. It is material to note that the appellant had addressed a letter\\nto the respondent on 13 December 2019 prior to the filing of the application to\\nwhich the respondent responded on 24 January 2020 stating that, upon\\nverification, the costs and fees were found in conformity with both the technical\\nand financial bid, based on which the assignment was awarded. In the\\napplication which was filed by the appellant before the NCLT, the appellant\\nannexed a statement of costs, the amount which was reimbursed with the\\nbalance dues at Annexure ‘D’. The order of the NCLT, however, reveals that\\nnone of the submissions of the appellant have been considered. The\\nadjudicating authority merely directed the respondent to pay the expenses\\nincurred and an amount of Rs 5,00,000 plus GST towards the fee of the RP.\\nNeither the basis of the claim nor its reasonableness has been considered by the\\nadjudicating authority. The appellate authority has merely proceeded in an ad\\nhoc manner on the ground that the amount of Rs 5,00,000 as fee, in addition to\\nthe expenses, appears to be reasonable. Both the orders suffer from an\\nabdication in the exercise of jurisdiction. In the absence of any reasons either in\\nthe order of the NCLT or the appellate authority, it is impossible for the Court to\\ndeduce the basis on which the payment of an amount of Rs 5,00,000 together\\nwith expenses has been found to be reasonable. Consequently, an order of\\nremand becomes necessary.8\\n17 We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and\\norder of the NCLAT dated 30 July 2020. Similarly, the order of NCLT dated 7\\nFebruary 2020 is set aside. MA No 223/2020 in CP (IB) 970/MB/2019 is restored\\nto the file of the NCLT for a decision afresh. The NCLT, upon remand, is\\nrequested to expedite the disposal of the MA and to complete the process within\\na period of one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order on\\nits record.\\n18 The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.\\n19 Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.\\n…………...…...….......………………........J.\\n[Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\\n…..…..…....…........……………….…........J.\\n[A S Bopanna]\\nNew Delhi;\\nJanuary 05, 2022\\n-S-9\\nITEM NO.16 Court 4 (Video Conferencing) SECTION XVII\\nS U P R E M E C O U R T O F I N D I A\\nRECORD OF PROCEEDINGS\\nCivil Appeal No(s).3160/2020\\nDEVARAJAN RAMAN Appellant(s)\\nVERSUS\\nBANK OF INDIA LIMITED Respondent(s)\\n(WITH IA No. 90821/2020 - PERMISSION TO FILE ADDITIONAL\\nDOCUMENTS/FACTS/ANNEXURES)\\nDate : 05-01-2022 This appeal was called on for hearing today.\\nCORAM :\\nHON\\'BLE DR.

Other respondents have chosen to remain\\nabsent in the hearing.\\n3. The appellant as plaintiff instituted Title Suit (P)\\nNo.34/05 (hereinafter mentioned as plaintiff) seeking partition\\nof the suit land described in the schedule of the plaint\\ncontending that the plaintiff is entitled to 1/5th share of the\\nsuit land. It is contended by the plaintiff that the suit land\\ndescribed in the schedule of the plaint originally belonged to\\nhis father Late Janendra Chandra Chakraborty and his father\\ndied leaving behind him and respondents (hereinafter\\nmentioned as defendants) Nos. 1, 2 and 4, Lt. Parimal\\nChakraborty, since deceased,(the father of respondent No.3\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 2 of 103\\nherein) as his sons and Smt. Makhanbala Chakraborty, the\\ndefendant No.3 (since deceased and struck off) as his wife.\\nThere was no partition of the suit land between the plaintiff\\nand the defendants and therefore, the plaintiff was not in a\\nposition to utilize his share of land in the un-partitioned\\nproperty to the best of his utility and he also alleged that the\\ndefendant No.1 is in possession of the land in access of his\\nshare and therefore, he proposed for amicable partition on\\n25.05.2005 but the defendants did not come up for an\\namicable partition and therefore, he instituted the suit\\nclaiming 1/5th share in the suit land and for partition with\\nmetes and bounds.\\n4. Defendant No.1, Samir Chakraborty contested the\\nsuit by filing written statement, inter alia, contending that the\\nsuit land was already partitioned among the legal heirs of late\\nJanendra Chandra Chakraborty and so, there was no question\\nof any further partition of the suit land. It is contended by the\\ndefendant that the suit land was allotted in the name of his\\nlate father Janendra Chandra Chakraborty who died in the\\nyear 1958. It is also contended by the defendant that one\\nPranab Kanti Basu and another had filed a suit for declaration\\nof title by adverse possession against the plaintiff and the\\ndefendants of this suit arraying them as defendants which was\\nregistered as T.S. 74/02 and in that suit, in Para 4 of the\\nwritten statement the plaintiff also made a clear statement\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 3 of 104\\nthat there was amicable partition of the suit land between the\\nplaintiff and the defendants of this suit in the year 1984 and\\nthat Makhan Bala Chakraborty, the mother of the plaintiff and\\nother defendants, sold out her share by a registered sale-deed\\ndated 26.04.84 to the defendant No.1 and since it was clearly\\nstated that there was an amicable partition of the suit land, it\\nis an admitted position that partition of the suit land was\\neffected between the legal heirs of Janendra Chandra\\nChakraborty and therefore, there is no question of further\\npartition of the suit land.\\n5. The trial Court considering the pleadings of the\\nparties, formulated 5(five) issues namely-\\ni. Is the suit maintainable?\\nii. Was the suit land partitioned amicably in the\\nyear 1984?\\niii. Is the suit land liable to be partitioned now\\nand whether the parties are entitled to get\\n1/5th share each?\\niv. Is the plaintiff entitled to get the decree as\\nprayed for?\\nv. To what other relief, plaintiff is entitled?\\n6. In course of trial, the plaintiff examined himself as\\nP.W.1 and proved the following documents:-\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 4 of 105\\nExbt.1 : Certified true copy of Khatian 618 of\\nMouja-Agartala, sheet no-19 relating to the suit\\nland.\\nExbt.2 : Certified true copy of the map relating to\\nthe suit land.\\nExbt.3 : Registered Power of Attorney, executed\\nby the plaintiff in favour of Shri Pradip Kr. Saha.\\n7. The defendant No.1 examined himself as D.W.1\\nand in support of his case, proved the following documents:\\nExbt. A : Certified true copy of the registered sale\\ndeed, dt. 27.4.84 executed by Smti. Makhan Bala\\nDebi in favour of defendant No-1.\\nExbt.B-1 & B series: Certified true copy of the\\nWritten Statement filed by the present defendants\\nin T.S.74/02 and signature of the plaintiff therein.\\nExbt.C: Certified true copy of Khatian 6043, of\\nMouja-Agartala Sheet No-19 relating to the suit\\nland.\\nExbt.D: Certified true copy of the Written\\nStatement of T.S.74/02.\\n8. The trial Court by impugned judged dated\\n29.03.2006 decided the issues against the plaintiff and\\ndismissed the suit.\\nHence, this appeal.\\n9. It is argued by learned counsel Mr.Bhattacharjee\\nfor the plaintiff-appellant that there is no document to show\\nthat there was partition of the suit land by metes and bounds\\nand that the trial Court taking into consideration the\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 5 of 106\\nstatements made in Exbt.A i.e. the sale-deed dated\\n27.04.1984 wrongly decided that the suit land was partitioned\\nbetween the plaintiff and the defendants. He has contended\\nthat the plaintiff was a witness to the execution of that deed\\nbetween Makhan Bala Chakraborty and defendant No.1\\n(mother and son) and he was simply an attesting witness to\\nthat deed and that he knew nothing about the contents of the\\ndeed. The trial Court taken into account the contents of the\\ndeed and the written statement (marked as Exbt. B series)\\nsubmitted in T.S. 74/02 and arrived at a wrong decision.\\nWhatever stated in the written statement in another suit\\ncannot be an evidence to prove that there was a partition of\\nthe suit land between the plaintiff and the defendants by\\nmetes and bounds. He has also submitted that it is to be\\npresumed that there was no partition between the plaintiff and\\nthe defendants and therefore, the plaintiff instituted the suit.\\nHad there been any partition between them, there was no\\nreason for the plaintiff to approach the Court for fresh\\npartition. The trial Court misread the pleadings and evidence\\nand wrongly dismissed the suit. Mr. Bhattacharjee, learned\\ncounsel for the plaintiff-appellant prayed for setting aside the\\ndecree of dismissal and further prayed for decree of the suit.\\n10. On the contrary, appearing for the defendant-\\nrespondent No.1, learned counsel Mr. Chakraborty has\\nsubmitted that the plaintiff himself admitted partition by filing\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 6 of 107\\nwritten statement in T.S. 74/02 and also admitted partition\\nbeing a witness to the sale-deed dated 27.4.1984, therefore,\\nthe plaintiff cannot take a different stand by filing a suit for\\npartition of the suit land afresh. Learned counsel, therefore,\\nprayed for dismissal of the appeal.\\n11. It is an admitted position that the plaintiff and all\\nthe defendants are the legal heirs of deceased Janendra\\nChandra Chakraborty. The suit land described in the schedule\\nof the plaint originally belonged to Janendra Chandra\\nChakraborty and it is an admitted fact that he died in the year\\n1958 leaving behind the plaintiff and the defendants as his\\nlegal heirs who were equally entitled to the suit land.\\nDefendant No.3 Makhan Bala Chakraborty, wife Lt. Janendra\\nChandra Chakraborty, mother of the plaintiff and other\\ndefendants died in the meantime and so defendant No.3 has\\nbeen struck off. Defendant No.4, Parimal Chakraborty also\\ndied in the meantime and his legal heir Smt. Raisona\\nChakraborty has been added as respondent No.3 in this\\nappeal. The plaintiff claimed that there was no partition of the\\nsuit land by metes and bounds. Defendant No.1 contested the\\nsuit by filing written statement that there was already a\\npartition of the suit land. Other defendants neither filed any\\nwritten statement nor contested the suit. The trial Court as it\\nappears very meticulously discussed the pleadings and\\nevidence on record and decided the issues against the\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 7 of 108\\nplaintiff. I have also meticulously gone through the pleadings\\nand the evidence on record. Exbt. B/1 is the written statement\\nsubmitted by the plaintiff, defendant No.1 and defendant No.3\\nMakhan Bala Chakraborty (since deceased) in TS 74/02. The\\nsignature of the plaintiff in the said written statement has\\nbeen proved by the plaintiff and marked as Exbt. B series. It\\nis, therefore, proved that the plaintiff and defendant Nos. 1\\nand 3 jointly filed a written statement in TS 74/02 wherein in\\nPara 4 of the written statement, the present plaintiff and\\ndefendant Nos. 1 and 3 stated ---\\n“4. That the land in Schedule-A of the complaint\\nis wholly a water tank just in front of the house of the\\nDefendants. The plaintiffs never claimed to have used\\nor possessed it until this suit. The plaintiffs are well\\naware that the said water tank has already been\\npartitioned among the Defendants by a family\\nsettlement in the year 1984. The share of the mother,\\nDefendant No.2 was purchased by Defendant No.3 Shri\\nSamir Kr. Chakraborty who has his separate share in\\nthe pond. By a composite deed executed on 26.04.84\\nthe sale of the mothers share and the partition of the\\npond property was registered. The Defendant No.3\\nthereafter earthfilled a part of his share in the year\\n1985-86. The Plaintiffs had no occasion to object or\\nprotest in such partition or earth filling. Now suddenly\\nprompted by some oblique motive the Plaintiff have\\nrisen up to claim the property perhaps tempted by the\\nvalue of the said property in the present market such\\nan unholy motive cannot be indulged by the Court of\\nlaw and hence the suit has to be dismissed.”\\n12. The above statement made by the present plaintiff\\nand defendant Nos. 1 and 3 clearly reveals that there was a\\npartition of the suit land through a family settlement in the\\nyear 1984 and thereafter the defendant No.3, Makhan Bala\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 8 of 109\\nChakraborty sold out her part of the land to the defendant\\nNo.1, i.e. her son Samir Chakraborty. The sale-deed executed\\nby Makhan Bala Chakraborty in favour of Samir Chakraborty\\nhas been proved as Exbt.A and in that document it has been\\nspecifically mentioned that the suit land was partitioned\\nmutually and Makhan Bala sold her part of the share to\\ndefendant No.1. In that sale-deed the plaintiff stood as a\\nwitness and signed the sale-deed. Parimal Chakraborty, since\\ndeceased, a brother of the plaintiff also stood as witness. The\\nplaintiff and the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 4 were all full blood\\nbrothers and defendant No.3 was their mother. While a deed\\nwas executed by the mother in favour of one of the sons and\\nother sons were present as witnesses, it may be presumed in\\nthe circumstances that the parties to the deed and the\\nwitnesses knew the fact what was stated in the document.\\nFurther, as I find the plaintiff did not state anything in his\\npleadings about the sale-deed executed by Makhan Bala in\\nfavour of defendant No.1. He has suppressed the fact and\\nclaimed 1/5th share whereas the defendant No.3 Makhan Bala\\nalready sold her share to defendant No.1 and it was within\\nthe knowledge of the plaintiff. The plaintiff also did not make\\nany averment in the plaint that he has no knowledge about\\nthe contents of the sale-deed. The stand of the plaintiff,\\ntherefore, suffers from suppression of material fact. From the\\naverments made in the written statement of T.S.74/02 and\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 9 of 1010\\nfrom the contents of the sale-deed dated 27.04.84, it is quite\\nclear that there was a partition through family settlement\\nbetween the plaintiff and the defendants in respect of the suit\\nland and hence, in my considered opinion, the trial Court\\nrightly dismissed the suit and I find no merit at all in the\\nargument advanced by learned counsel Mr. Bhattacharjee to\\ndecree the suit.\\n13. Accordingly, the appeal stands dismissed with\\ncosts.\\n14. Send back the L.C. records along with a copy of\\nthis judgment.\\nJUDGE\\nRFA 8 of 2006 Page 10 of 10',\n",

DEEPAK GUPTA\\nFor the petitioners : Mr. D K Biswas, Advocate.\\nFor the respondents : Mr. S M Chakraborty, Sr. Advocate,\\nMs. B Chakraborty, Advocate.\\nDate of hearing : 20.4.2015.\\nDelivery of judgment : 30.5.2015.\\nWhether fit for reporting : Yes.\\nJUDGMENT & ORDER\\nThis petition by the petitioners(hereinafter referred to as\\nthe defendants) is directed against the order dated 22.5.2012 passed\\nby the learned Civil Judge(Sr. Division), Kailashahar, North Tripura\\nrejecting the application filed by the defendants under Order VII Rule\\n11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint.\\n2. In view of the decision which I propose to take it is not\\nnecessary to give the entire facts of the case. However, it would be\\npertinent to mention that the parties are closely related to each other\\nand all derive their title from their common predecessor Late Shri Akhil\\nChandra Ghosh. It is not disputed that Akhil Chandra Ghosh was the\\nowner of the suit land. It is alleged that prior to the coming into force\\nof the Tripura Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960 (TLR & LR Act,\\nCRP No.64 of 2012 Page 2 of 83\\n1960) which was enforced on 15.4.1963 Akhil Chandra Ghosh with a\\nview to avoid the rigours of the Act executed a virtually fraudulent\\ntransaction transferring the suit property in favour of his daughter Gita\\nRani Majumder(Ghosh). According to the plaintiffs, Late Smt. Gita Rani\\nMajumder(Ghosh) was never placed in possession of the suit land and\\nthe plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land.\\n3. The following reliefs were claimed by the plaintiffs :\\n“A) Declaring the aforesaid plaintiffs are the exclusive owners\\nand possessors of the suit land and suit property scheduled below\\nand that defendant nos.1(a) to 1(e) have no right, title or interest or\\npossession over the suit land and suit property and further that\\ndefendant nos.2 to 5 have also no right over or in relation to the said\\nsuit land;\\nB) Declaring that the suit deed dated 13.1.2012 is illegal,\\ninfructuous, ineffective, collusive, fraudulent and not binding upon\\nthe plaintiff;\\nC) Granting and issuing perpetual injunction restraining\\ndefendant nos.1(a) to 1(e) from transferring the suit land or any\\nportion thereof in favour of defendant nos.2 to 5 or to any other\\nperson, and from encumbering said land with any person, and from\\nexecuting any deed to those effects;\\nD) Granting all other reliefs deemed fit and proper;\\nA N D\\nE) Granting full cost of litigation.”\\n4. The defendants 1(a) to 1(e) i.e. the petitioners herein filed\\nan application under Order VII Rule 11(d) CPC stating that the suit was\\nbarred by the provisions of Section 188 of the TLR & LR Act, 1960.\\nAccording to the defendants, Akhil Chandra Ghosh (who was an\\nCRP No.64 of 2012 Page 3 of 84\\nintermediary) settled his daughter as a tenant of the land and after\\nenforcement of TLR & LR Act, 1960 Akhil Chandra Ghosh had no\\nconnection with the land which vested in the State and in terms of the\\nprovisions of the Act Gita Rani Majumder(Ghosh) became a tenant\\ndirectly under the government. Various other issues had been raised\\nthat the suit is not within the limitation and that the suit is an abuse of\\nthe process of the Court but the main issue in the application was that\\nthe suit is barred by law. The learned trial Court rejected the\\napplication. Hence this petition.\\n5. Mr. D K Biswas learned counsel strenuously contends that\\nthe document in favour of Gita Rani Majumder(Ghosh) was executed in\\nthe year 1962 to the knowledge of the plaintiffs and, therefore, after\\n50 years they cannot challenge the same and the suit is misconceived\\nand fictitious and this should be nipped in the bud. He also submits that\\nthe suit is barred under the provisions of the TLR & LR Act, 1960.\\n6. Strong reliance has been placed by Mr. D K Biswas on the\\njudgment of the Apex Court in Roop Lal Sathi Vs. Nachhattar Singh\\nGill, (1982) 3 SCC 487 wherein the Apex Court held that where the\\nplaint discloses no cause of action, it is obligatory upon the Court to\\nreject the plaint as a whole under Order VII, Rule 11(a) of the Code. At\\nthe same time the Apex Court held that the suit cannot be partly\\nrejected. According to Mr. Biswas, since the suit is barred, the same\\ndeserves to be rejected.\\nCRP No.64 of 2012 Page 4 of 85\\n7. Mr. Biswas also placed reliance on the judgment of the\\nApex Court in Sopan Sukhdeo Sable and others vs. Assistant Charity\\nCommissioner and Others, (2004) 3 SCC 137 wherein the Apex Court\\nheld as follows :\\n“10. In Saleem Bhai and others v. State of Maharashtra and\\nothers, 2003(1) SCC 557 : 2003(1) RCR(Civil) 464(SC) it was held\\nwith reference to Order VII Rule 11 of the Code that the relevant\\nfacts which need to be looked into for deciding an application\\nthereunder are the averments in the plaint. The trial Court can\\nexercise the power at any stage of the suit before registering the\\nplaint or after issuing summons to the defendant at any time\\nbefore, the conclusion of the trial. For the purposes of deciding an\\napplication under clauses (a) and (d) of Order VII Rule 11 of the\\nCode, the averments in the plaint are the germane; the pleas\\ntaken by the defendant in the written statement would be wholly\\nirrelevant at that stage.\\n11. In T.T.C. Ltd. v. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal and\\nothers, 1998(1) RCR(Civil) 391 (SC) : 1998(2) SCC 70 it was held that\\nthe basic question to be decided while dealing with an application\\nfiled under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code is whether a real cause of\\naction has been set out in the plaint or something purely illusory\\nhas been stated with a view to get out of Order VII Rule 11 of the\\nCode.\\n12. The trial court must remember that if on a meaningful and\\nnot formal residing of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious and\\nmeritless in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, it\\nshould exercise the power under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code\\ntaking care to see that the grounds mentioned therein is fulfilled.\\nIf clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, it has\\nto be nipped in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party\\nsearchingly under Order X of the Code. (See T. Arviandandam v.\\nT.V. Satvapal and anr., 1977(4) SCC 467)\\nCRP No.64 of 2012 Page 5 of 86\\n13. It is trite law that not any particular plea has to be\\nconsidered and the whole plaint has to be read. As was observed\\nby this Court in Roop Lal Sathi v. Nachhattar Singh Gill, 1982(3)\\nSCC 487, only a part of the plaint cannot be rejected and if no\\ncause of action is disclosed, the plaint as a whole must be rejected.\\n…………………………………………………………………………………..\\n15. There cannot be any compartmentalization, dissection,\\nsegregation and inversions of the language of various paragraphs\\nin the plaint. If such a course in adopted it would run counter to\\nthe cardinal canon of interpretation according to which a pleading\\nhas to be read as a whole to ascertain its true import. It is not\\npermissible to cull out a sentence or a passage and to read it out\\nof the context in isolation. Although it is the substance and not\\nmerely the form that has to be looked into, the pleading has to be\\nconstrued as it stands without addition or subtraction or words or\\nchange of its apparent grammatical sense. The intention of the\\nparty concerned is to be gathered primarily from the tenor and\\nterms of his pleadings taken as a whole. At the same time it should\\nbe borne in mind that no pedantic approach should be adopted to\\ndefeat justice on hair-splitting technicalities.”\\n8. At the outset I may state that this Court is not going into\\nthe question whether the suit is barred by limitation. It would,\\nhowever, be pertinent to mention that one of the reliefs claimed in the\\nsuit is that the plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land. Assuming for\\nthe sake of argument that the defendants have no title over the suit\\nland, even then if they are in possession they cannot be dispossessed of\\nthe suit land except in accordance with law. Mr. Biswas submits that\\neven if that be the position then this plaint should be rejected with\\nliberty given to the plaintiffs to file a fresh suit limiting their prayer to\\nCRP No.64 of 2012 Page 6 of 87\\npossession as above. This argument cannot be accepted. In the\\njudgment relied upon by Mr. Biswas, the Apex Court held as follows:\\n“………………………… .Where the plaint discloses no cause of action, it\\nis obligatory upon the Court to reject the plaint as a whole under\\nOrder VII, Rule 11 (a) of the Code, but the rule does not justify the\\nrejection of any particular portion of a plai...................................”\\nIt is settled law that a plaint cannot be partly rejected.\\nTherefore, even if there was no merit in the other arguments of the\\nplaintiffs they have a right to protect their possession in case they are\\nin possession of the land. This is a question which will have to be\\ndecided on the basis of evidence and, therefore, I find no illegality in\\nthe order of the trial Court and no order in this regard.\\n9. It may be true as urged by Mr. Biswas that there is very\\nlittle merit in the suit. That will depend on the finding whether the\\nplaintiffs are in possession of the suit land or not. In case they are in\\npossession of the suit land, many other questions would arise.\\nTherefore, evidence would have to be led to decide this case. As such I\\nfind no merit in the petition.\\n10. It is made clear that this Court has expressed no opinion on\\nthe merits of the rival contentions of the parties and anything stated in\\nthis judgment is only meant to decide this petition and will have no\\nbearing on the decision of the main suit which must be decided on the\\nbasis of the evidence led by the parties.\\nCRP No.64 of 2012 Page 7 of 88\\n11. Keeping in view the nature of the disputes and also the\\nfact that the document which has been challenged was executed more\\nthan 50 years back, it is directed that the parties shall appear before\\nthe learned trial Court on 30th June, 2015 by which date the\\npetitioner-defendants must file their written statement. The learned\\ntrial Court shall make an effort to decide the case, as early as possible\\nand in any event not later than 31st December, 2015.\\n12. Registry is directed to ensure that the LCR is sent well\\nbefore the next date.\\n13. Petition is disposed of accordingly.\\nCHIEF JUSTICE\\nCRP No.64 of 2012 Page 8 of 8',\n",

The defendants, the respondents No.1,2 and 3 herein,\\ncontested the suit by filing the written statement challenging the\\npleadings therein. However, by the judgment dated 02.02.2009, the\\nsuit was dismissed.\\n[7] Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated\\n02.02.2009, the appellant presented an appeal under Section 96 of\\nthe C.P.C. along with an application for condonation of delay under\\nSection 5 of the Limitation Act as there was delay of 52 days in\\npresenting the said appeal which has been registered as Title Appeal\\nNo.02 of 2009. In the said application for condonation of delay,\\nbeing Misc. 02 of 2009, the causes as shown by the appellant for\\nsuch delay is that while he was consulting with the engaged counsel\\nnamely, Koushik Roy, suddenly his father, the counsel’s father,\\nRSA No. 61 of 2009 Page 3 of 5[4]\\nexpired and he was in bereavement and thereafter, he suffered from\\nserious form of skin disease. As a result, there was a dislocation in\\ncollection of the certified copy of the judgment and decree and\\npreparation of the memorandum of appeal along with the application\\nfor condoning the delay. Even they filed an application under Order\\nXLI Rule 27 of the C.P.C. along with the appeal. By the order dated\\n26.08.2009 delivered in Misc. 02 of 2009, the first appellate court\\nhas observed that the delay has not been satisfactorily explained to\\nshow that the delay as caused was not for the latches and negligent\\nof the plaintiff-appellant but for reasons beyond his control. It has\\nbeen also observed that why the appellant did not engage another\\ncounsel for filing the appeal has not been explained. Finally, on\\nobserving that the grounds displayed by the appellant are do not\\nconstitute sufficient cause, the prayer for condoning the delay was\\nrejected, on placing reliance on the decision of the apex court in\\nCollector, Land Acquisition Anantanag and another vs. Mst.\\nKatiji and others, reported in AIR 1987 SC 1353. It is well known\\nthat in that decision, the apex court has observed that in the matter\\nof condoning the delay, no pedantic approach should be adopted by\\nthe court, the court must have to see at the substantive ends of the\\njustice.\\n[8] On scrutiny of the impugned order dated 26.08.2009, it\\nhas also transpired that the first appellate court has observed as\\nunder:\\nRSA No. 61 of 2009 Page 4 of 5[5]\\nIn the present case, the grounds for condonation\\nof delay put forward are the sad demise of the\\nfather of the Ld. Advocate, Mr. K. Roy and also his\\nillness. The said demise of the father of the Ld.\\nAdvocate might be true. But in respect of illness\\nno medical certificate, prescriptions have been\\ndisplayed to substantiate the grounds of illness.\\n[9] In this perspective and considering the length of the\\ndelay, this Court is of the considered opinion that the first appellate\\ncourt ought to have condoned the delay of 52 days in presenting the\\nappeal. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 26.08.2009 delivered\\nin Misc. 02 of 2009 is interfered with and set aside. The delay of 52\\ndays in presenting the appeal against the judgment and decree\\nrespectively dated 02.02.2009 and 12.02.2009 delivered in Title Suit\\nNo.20 of 2009 by the Civil Judge, Jr. Division, Sonamura, West\\nTripura is hereby condoned. Consequently, the order dated\\n26.08.2009 delivered in Title Appeal No.02 of 2009 is set aside and\\nquashed. This Court will not make any observation on the other\\nsubstantial questions of law as this Court remands hereby the appeal\\nbeing Title Appeal No.02 of 2009 to be heard on merit by the first\\nappellate court.\\nAccordingly, this appeal is allowed.\\nPrepare the decree accordingly.\\nSend down the LCRs thereafter.\\nJUDGE\\nSSSSuuuujjjjaaaayyyy\\nRSA No. 61 of 2009 Page 5 of 5']"
